PAST MEDICAL HISTORY I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ME WITH A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING A LIST OF HER CURRENT MEDICATION AS UNFORTUNATELY NONE WAS INCLUDED WITH YOUR ORIGINAL LETTER OF THE 11TH MAY 2006. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY NONE KNOWN.

PERSONAL HISTORY BORN IN ~$ WORKED I BELIEVE IN THE ~ BUSINESS UNTIL THE WAR AND THEN WENT ON TO DO WAR WORK SINCE WORKING IN THE ~ CLEARING BANK UNTIL THE BIRTH OF HER CHILDREN. SHE MET HER HUSBAND DURING THE WAR WHO WAS WORKING AS A ~ ENGINEER AND WHO LATTERLY WENT INTO THE ARMY FINALLY SERVING IN ~ POST WAR. SHE HAS 3 CHILDREN 2 BOYS AND 1 GIRL$ UNFORTUNATELY HER DAUGHTER DIED A FEW YEARS AGO FROM CANCER$ THEY HAVE GRANDCHILDREN ALL OF WHICH INCLUDING THE 2 SONS LIVE AWAY. THEY MOVED TO ~ 25 YEARS AGO TO ~ AND THEN 13 YEARS AGO THEY MOVED TO ~. SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES LIVES WITH HER HUSBAND IN A SMALL WARDEN MANAGED FLAT AT THE TOP OF ~. BY HER OWN ADMISSION HER ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE CHAOTIC AS HER MEMORY PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME MORE APPARENT TO HER. INCREASINGLY THIS CAUSES SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION AND HER HUSBAND WHO IS OF A SIMILAR AGE WHO FEELS HE HAS SIMILAR PROBLEMS TENDS TO AGGRAVATE HER SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS HIS POOR MOOD AND SHORT TEMPER AND WHILST INTERRUPTING HER CONFUSES HER AND INCREASES THE CHAOTIC NATURE OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. BOTH OF THEM ADMIT THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS QUITE STRAINED. APPEARANCE & BEHAVIOUR AT INTERVIEW TODAY SHE WAS WELL PRESENTED WELL DRESSED HAD GOOD EYE CONTACT$ WAS SLIGHTLY SUSPICIOUS OF ME AND MY REASON FOR BEING THERE BUT DID SETTLE VERY WELL TO THE DISCUSSION AND ATTENDED VERY WELL TO ALL THAT WAS ASKED OF HER. SHE ADMITS TO BEING ANXIOUS AND PANICKY OR SLIGHTLY GREGARIOUS AND UNINHIBITED IN BEHAVIOUR. SPEECH SOME LOOSENING OF ASSOCIATION AND WORD FINDING DIFFICULTIES WERE EVIDENT TODAY SOMETHING WHICH SHE FEELS INCREASED HER LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION AND AGITATION AND IF PRESSURED MAKES QUITE PANICKY. MOOD SHE DOES REPORT BEING ANXIOUS AND PANICKY AT TIMES. OBJECTIVELY I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE AND NOTICEABLY INCREASES HER LEVEL OF BEHAVIOUR. CONCENTRATION POOR THOUGHTS PERHAPS BEST DESCRIBED AS BEING ANXIOUS AND PERPLEXED HAS BEEN MANAGING BY ROUTINE BUT INCREASINGLY NOW THIS IS BECOMING LESS POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH SHE DOES REFLECT THAT HER VARIABLE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT OF MEMORY DOES MEAN THAT SHE HAS BETTER TIMES THAN OTHERS. PERCEPTIONS HAS QUITE FIXED THOUGHTS THAT PEOPLE ARE AGAINST HER ALL OF WHICH I'M SURE ARE VERY VARIABLE IN NATURE AND DEGREE. BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND AGREE THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP CURRENTLY IS QUITE STRAINED AND DURING THE INTERVIEW WITH THEM BOTH AT TIMES WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING SHE WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN HERSELF IN THE DENIAL OF THE THINGS THAT HE WAS SAYING ABOUT HER LEVEL OF BEHAVIOUR$ ATTENTION$ CONCENTRATION$ ETC. BUT THEN 2 MINUTES LATER WOULD REPORT THE SAME FINDINGS. COGNITIVE I DID FORMALLY ASSESS HER USING THE MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION. SHE HAD GOOD ORIENTATION TO TIME AND REASONABLE TO PLACE. HER COMPREHENSION WAS POOR AND SHE SHOWED SOME SIGNIFICANT EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING DEFICITS. HER MINI MENTAL SCORE WAS 19/30. INSIGHT I THINK THIS IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AT PRESENT CERTAINLY IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING THINGS WITH THE HUSBAND I WOULD SAY SHE HAS NO INSIGHT AND NO AGREEMENT WITH HIM ABOUT ANY PROBLEMS THAT SHE HAS. WITH ME AND AT INTERVIEW TODAY SHE CLEARLY DID HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO HER CIRCUMSTANCES AND DESPITE TO ME THAT SHE WOULD BE NON COMPLIANT OF THINGS I MIGHT BE ASKING OF HER I FOUND HER TO BE QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND THE ONLY CONFRONTATION THAT OCCURRED WERE AT THE POINTS WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS INVOLVED IN DISCUSSION. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING CLEARLY BY HER OWN ADMISSION THINGS WITHIN SIDE THE HOME ARE BECOMING RATHER CHAOTIC BOTH OF THEM ARE CONCERNED AT HER ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM AS THEY GET OLDER. SHE IS BECOMING MORE ANXIOUS AND PANICKY WHILST TRYING TO COMPLETE TASKS AND CLEARLY RECOGNISES THAT SHE IS FORGETTING TO EVEN COMMENCE SOME. THERE IS SOME ELEMENT OF CONFABULATION WHICH RATHER CONFUSES THE PICTURE ABOUT WHAT HER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY REALLY IS BUT A REFLECTION OF THE HOME AND THE LETTER THAT YOU SENT TO ME IS FAIRLY DESCRIPTIVE OF THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE.

THE NATURE AND PATTERN OF THE ORIGINAL PROCESS APPEARS TO BE THAT SIMILAR TO THAT OF AN ALZHEIMER'S TYPE DEMENTIA BUT IN RECENT TIMES IT APPEARS THIS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE VARIABLE AND HAS INCREASED FROM TIME TO TIME. SHE DOES REPORT HAVING SMALL BLACKOUTS AND PERIODS OF VACANCIES AND MOST PROBABLY THEREFORE NOW THERE IS A VASCULAR COMPONENT TO THE PROBLEMS. CLEARLY BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE AT EACH OTHERS THROATS ON A REGULAR BASIS. MY FIRST THOUGHTS THEREFORE IS TO CREATE AN ELEMENT OF SEPARATION$ SHE DOES REASONABLY GOOD NETWORK OF FRIENDS FROM THE ~ CHURCH BUT I AM GOING TO ASK HER TO ATTEND THE DAY HOSPITAL AT ~~ ONCE A WEEK AND ASK SOCIAL SERVICES WITH SUPERVISION AND SUPPORT TO START SLOWLY PUTTING IN A CARE PACKAGE IN THE LATE MORNINGS TO HELP MONITOR AND SUPPORT THE HOME SITUATION.

FN03816,7327120,#Seen in psychiatry clinic,CLINICAL LETTER ~ HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY DEAR DR ~ ~~~$ DOB ~/1913 ~~~~I REVIEWED MRS ~ IN ~ OUTPATIENT CLINIC ON 27TH JANUARY 2010. THIS 96 YEAR OLD LADY HAS A HISTORY OF PROGRESSIVE MEMORY IMPAIRMENT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. HER DEMENTIA HAS BECOME WORSE AND SHE IS NOW MORE REPETITIVE AND WANDERSOME. SHE GOES TO HER DAUGHTER ~ HOME FREQUENTLY. THE DAUGHTERS HUSBAND HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM ENDURING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND SHE HERSELF IS UNDER STRESS BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDING BEHAVIOUR OF HER MOTHER WHO OFTEN VISITS HER AT UNUSUAL TIMES OF THE DAY. MRS ~ IS A STRONG-WILLED PERSON AND IS USUALLY SOCIABLE AND HAPPY-GO-LUCKY. SHE ATTENDS THE DAY CENTRE AND ALSO RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM HER DAUGHTER. A SOCIAL WORKER HAS ASSESSED HER NEEDS$ SHE HAS CARERS AND ARRANGEMENTS ARE DUE TO BE MADE TO PROVIDE MEALS. SHE HAS HAD TWO FALLS AND HAS HEARING PROBLEMS. HOWEVER$ AS MENTIONED ABOVE$ BEING A STRONG-WILLED PERSON SHE DOES NOT BOTHER TO WEAR THE HEARING AIDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED TO HER. SHE HAS BEEN SHOWING EVIDENCE OF INCREASED INCOHERENCE$ WANDERSOME ACTIVITY AND IMPAIRED ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING NECESSITATING MORE SUPPORT AND CARE FROM HER DAUGHTER$ ~. HER OTHER DAUGHTER IS BEING CARED FOR IN ~~. BECAUSE OF HER RECENT FALLS THE SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN ALERTED WITH A VIEW TO ORGANISING AN APPROPRIATE CARE PACKAGE. AT INTERVIEW I FOUND HER FORGETFUL$ DISORIENTATED BUT COOPERATIVE AND COMPLIANT. HER SON AND DAUGHTER WERE PRESENT DURING THE OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENT. I DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF ARRANGING RESPITE CARE SO AS TO GET HER USED TO THE IDEA OF BEING LOOKED AFTER AND TO GIVE HER DISTRESSED DAUGHTER A WELL-DESERVED BREAK. PLAN: I HAVE THEREFORE SENT A COPY OF MY LETTER TO THE INVOLVED SOCIAL WORKER$ ~~ AND ALSO A COPY TO ~~ WITH A REQUEST TO CONSIDER SHORT TERM RESPITE CARE WITH A VIEW TO CONSIDER LONGER TERM CARE AS SHE HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE ALZHEIMERS DISEASE (F00.1). I HAVE ALSO ARRANGED FOR HER TO BE REVIEWED IN TWO MONTHS TIME. IN THE MEANTIME CURRENT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD CONTINUE. I HAVE NOT CHANGED HER MEDICATION AT THIS STAGE.

EARLIER ON SHE HAD CANCELLED HER PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT ARRANGED FOR 24/3/2010. HER SON AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE FOLLOW UP CLINIC. THEY ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON MRS ~ DAUGHTER (~). HER OTHER DAUGHTER HAS ALREADY BEEN IN ~~ FOR LONG-TERM CARE. WHEN SEEN IN CLINIC SHE HAS REMAINED FORGETFUL$ DISORIENTATED AND SELF-NEGLECTFUL WITH IMPAIRED ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. HOWEVER$ SHE IS A VERY SOCIABLE TYPE OF PERSON AND IN SPITE OF HER STRONG-WILLED PERSONALITY SHE ENJOYS HER ATTENDANCE AT THE DAY CENTRE. INPUT FROM THE INVOLVED SOCIAL WORKER (~~) DID NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL. SHE WILL MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO ORGANISE EMERGENCY RESPITE CARE TO TRY TO GET HER USED TO THE IDEA OF BEING LOOKED AFTER. PLAN: 1. I FEEL THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER HER LONG TERM CARE IN AN ~ RESIDENTIAL HOME. OTHERWISE A CRISIS MAY BE PRECIPITATED AT ANY TIME. I FELT THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE INTERMEDIATE CARE TEAM AS WELL AS THE HOME SUPPORT TEAM MAY NEED TO BE INVOLVED. I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF SENDING COPIES OF MY LETTER TO BOTH THE INTERMEDIATE CARE TEAM AND THE HOME SUPPORT TEAM. 2. I FEEL THAT ALTHOUGH THIS LADY$ WITH PROGRESSIVE MEMORY IMPAIRMENT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS REMAINED PHYSICALLY STABLE$ SHE NEEDS SUPPORT$ CARE$ SUPERVISION AND ASSISTANCE IN PLANNING$ ORGANISING AND ASSISTING IN HER DAILY ROUTINE AND AS SHE IS A STRONG-WILLED PERSON WITH VARIABLE COMPLIANCE$ INSTITUTIONAL CARE IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME MAY BE INEVITABLE. 3. HOWEVER$ SHORT TERM RESPITE CARE MAY GET HER USED TO THE IDEA OF BEING LOOKED AFTER AS SHE IS BASICALLY A SOCIABLE PERSON WHO LIKES TO INTERACT AND CHAT WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND HER. 4.

PRESENTING HISTORY THIS IS A 74 YEAR MAN WHO HAS NOTICED THAT HIS COGNITION IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS$ BUT COULD NOT QUITE PUT HIS FINGER ON THE CHANGE. hE HAS BEEN HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY RETRIEVING PEOPLES NAMES AND OCCASIONAL TOP OF THE TONGUE PHENOMENA. HISTORY FROM THE WIFE IS THAT 2 YEARS SHE NOTICED THAT HIS SHORT TERM MEMORY WAS STARTING TO DECLINE AND HE WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY FORGETFUL. THIS HAS GOT EXPEDIENTLY WORSE IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS TO THE POINT SHE HAS HAD TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER ORDER ADLS SUCH AS FINANCES. SHE DESCRIBED HOW HE WAS ALWAYS METICULOUS WRITING AND KEEPING NOTE OF EXPENSESBUT THIS HAD ALL CEASED AND HE WAS LOSING WHERE HAD PUT DOCUMENTS. HE IS STILL CAPABLE OF HELPING WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND BASIC ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING SUCH AS GETTING UP AND WASHING AND DRESSING. OF NOTE IS THAT HE CONTINUES TO DRIVE AND HAS DRIVEN ALL HIS LIFE BECAUSE OF BEING A SALES REPRESENTATIVE. HIS WIFE FEELS THAT THE MECHANICS OF DRIVING REMAIN THE SAME. HE IS NOT GETTING LOST BUT SHE DOES FEEL THAT HE DOESNT SEE THINGS AS QUICKLY AS SHE DOES AND THAT HIS REACTION TIME IS SLIGHTLY DOWN. HIS APPETITE AND SLEEP REMAIN GOOD AND THERES BEEN MINOR CHANGE IN PERSONALITY IN THAT HE SOCIALISES AND TALKS SLIGHTLY LESS. TENDS TO LOSE TRACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY I GATHER HE HAS HAD A RAISED CHOLESTEROL IN THE PAST BUT IS NOW NO LONGER ON A STATIN. HE SUFFERS FROM ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND CROHNS AND HAS HAD A RECENT FLARE WHICH IS BEING TREATED WITH PREDNISOLONE IN DECREASING DOSES. HE HAS OSTEOPOROSIS BUT HIS MOBILITY REMAINS GOOD. HIS EYESIGHT AND HEARING ARE PAGE 1 OF 2 ~~NHS NO:~LATER LIFE SERVICES MEMORY CLINIC COMMUNITY AND DAY TREATMENT UNIT ~ HOSPITAL~~~END OF PAGE--------GOOD AND HIS CONTINENECE IS REASONABLE. HE IS A NON SMOKER AND DOESNT DRINK ALCOHOL TO EXCESS. MEDICATION AS PER YOU DESCRIBED WITH THE ADDITION OF PREDNISOLONE I GATHER RECENTLY AND ALSO THAT HIS AZOTHIOPRINE HAS BEEN STOPPED. HE DOES HIS ONE MEDICATION BUT HAS A DOSETT BOX AND HIS WIFE SUPERVISES. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY NO MAJOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. FAMILY HISTORY MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER SUFFERED FROM DEMENTIA AS DID A FIRST COUSIN BUT NIL ELSE. HE IS AN ONLY CHILD. PERSONAL HISTORY BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN ~ AND LEFT SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF 15. HE WORKED AS A SALES REPRESENTATIVE $ AND ENJOYED HIS JOB AND PARTICULARLY THE DRIVING. HE STAYED ON IN HIS JOB UNTIL THE AGE OF 66 AND THEN RETIRED. HE IS PRESENTLY MARRIED AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS ANFD THEY HAVE HAD ALOT OF STRESSES RECENTLY. THEIR YOUNGEST SON HAS BEEN IN ~ 18 MONTHS AGO HAVING HAD A HEART TRANSPLANT. THEY ACTED AS POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR A NEIGHBOUR AND WERE BEING CALLED ON VERY FREQUENTLY WHICH HAS LED TO CONSIDERABLE STRESS FOR THE WIFE. THEY HAVE 2 SONS ONE IN ~ AND ONE IN ~ TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF GRANDCHILDREN. THERE PRESENT ACCOMMODATION IS A BUNGALOW$ THEY ARE RECIEPT OF PENSION AND HAVE POWER OF ATTORNEY IN PLACE. MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION. HE IS A VERY PLEASANT MAN WITH GOOD SOCIAL SKILL AND WAS ALSO GOOD WITHIN CONVERSATION. HIS MOOD IS EUTHYMIC AND HE HAS NO PERCEPTUAL PROBLEMS AND ON COGNITIVE TESTING HE SCORED 23/30 ON THE MMSE AND 59/100 ON THE ACE-R. HE SHOWED MAINLY FRONTAL EXECUTIVE/SUBCORTICAL PROBLEMS. HIS VERBAL FLUENCY AND FREE RECALL WERE POOR BUT PROMPTED RECALL WERE VERY GOOD. MANAGEMENT I SUSPECT HE MAY HAVE A DEGREE OF SMALL VESSEL DISEASE WHICH IS CAUSING EXECUTIVE AND SUBCORTICAL DYSFUNCTION$ THIS IS LEADING TO TIP OF THE TONGUE PHENOMENA$ RETRIEVAL DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS WITH SEQUENCING AND PLANNING. THERE MAY ALSO BE CO-MORBID ALZHEIMERS AND WITH THIS IN MIND I HAVE ORDERED AN MRI SCAN AND WILL BE SEEING HIM FOLLOWING THIS IN APPROXIMATELY 8 WEEKS TIME.

AS YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH HIS MEMORY AND AN MRI SCAN RESULT SHOWED HYPERINTENSITIES IN THE DEEP WHITE MATTER AND IN THE PERIVENTRICULAR AREAS. THE HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION WAS ENTIRELY NORMAL WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE A DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMERS. THEREFORE IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSIS HE WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE VASCULAR DEMENTIA SECONDARY TO SMALL VESSEL DISEASE. I HAVE DISCUSSED THE DIAGNOSIS WITH MR ~ AND HIS WIFE AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIFESTYLE CHANGES$ DIET$ AND EXERCISE AND ALSO TO GET HIS CHOLESTEROL CHECKED AS THATS THE ONLY VASCULAR RISK FACTOR I THINK I COULD FIND. I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH HIM REGARDING ATTENDANCE ALLOWANCE AND THE EMERGENCY FAMILY CARERS PLAN. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF HIS GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER NAMELY HIS CROHNS I DO NOT THINK HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE USUAL MEDICATIONS FOR SMALL VESSEL DISEASE SUCH AS ASPIRIN OR CLOPIDOGREL.

HOWEVER I HIGHLIGHTED THAT HER MEMORY SHOULD DETERIORATE SHE NEEDS TO MAKE A PLAN OF WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. SHE STATED THAT ON THIS REFLECTION IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO PLAN AHEAD. IMPRESSION 1. ?VASCULAR DEMENTIA. 2. SOME LOW MOOD SYMPTOMS SEEMINGLY SURROUNDING BOREDOM. I DISCUSSED THE CASE WITH DR ~ AND WE CAME UP WITH THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT PLAN. 1. I FEEL THAT MRS ~~ REQUIRES A SOMEWHAT URGENT ASSESSMENT BY SOCIAL SERVICES REGARDING ANY HOME HELP THAT CAN BE PROVIDED ON WAYS TO SUPPORT THE CARERS. I WILL MAKE A REFERRAL TO SOCIAL SERVICES. 2. I WILL ASK SOCIAL SERVICES IF THEY CAN SET UP VISITS FOR ~ TO VISIT THE LOCAL DAY CENTRE ~ DAY CARE CENTRE$ IN ORDER THAT SHE CAN SOCIALISE AND MEET SOME NEW FRIENDS. SHE FEELS THAT THIS WOULD IMPROVE HER MOOD CONSIDERABLY. 3. I HAVE MADE A REFERRAL TO OUR ~ CLINIC WHERE WE WILL GIVE ~ A THOROUGH PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ECG AND CHECK HER BLOODS. 4. I WILL ASSESS HER AGAIN IN TWO MONTHS TIME FOLLOWING THIS MANAGEMENT PLAN. IF ~ FEELS THAT HER MOOD HAS WORSENED THEN WE COULD CONSIDER OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS THEN. ~ STATES THAT SHE WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE SOMEBODY FROM SOCIAL SERVICES AT HER HOUSE TO DISCUSS HER NEEDS.

TP12654,4539435,#Seen in psychiatry clinic,DR ~~ PSYCHIATRY ~~ 10/10/06 I SAW MRS ~~ AT HER HOME AS A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT ON THE 10 OCTOBER 2006 AT 11:00 AM. ALSO PRESENT WAS HER NEPHEW'S WIFE IN ORDER TO GIVE A COLLATERAL HISTORY. MRS ~~ STATED THAT NOT MUCH HAD CHANGED SINCE I LAST ATTENDED AND THAT SOCIAL SERVICES HAD NOT BEEN IN TOUCH. MRS ~~ SAID THAT HER MEMORY IS THE SAME AS AT MY LAST APPOINTMENT AND HAS NOT WORSENED. HER NEPHEW'S WIFE CONFIRMED THIS. THEY DESCRIBED THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO DETERIORATION BUT SHE STILL FORGETS OCCASIONAL APPOINTMENTS AND LOSES HER KEYS$ HOWEVER$ THERE HAVE BEEN NO DANGEROUS OCCURRENCES IN THE HOUSE. MRS ~~ IS NOW HOUSEBOUND WITH HER ARTHRITIS OTHER THAN OCCASIONAL TRIPS OUT ONCE A WEEK WITH HER NEPHEW. HER NEPHEW'S WIFE BRINGS ROUND HOT MEALS EVERY DAY SO MRS ~~ DOES NOT NEED TO COOK. MRS ~~ FEELS THAT ISOLATION IS HER MAIN PROBLEM AS SHE CURRENTLY HAS NO FRIENDS THAT SHE CAN SOCIALISE WITH. THIS LOWERS HER MOOD ALTHOUGH SHE STATES THAT SHE IS HAPPY ON THE WHOLE AND SHE HAS NO OTHER WORRIES. SHE DESCRIBES HER SLEEP AS 8 HOURS PER NIGHT. HER APPETITE IS GOOD WITH NO WEIGHT LOSS SINCE HER LAST APPOINTMENT. HER NEPHEW'S WIFE STATES THAT THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM PERHAPS HAVING A DAY CENTRE WHERE MRS ~~ COULD GO IN ORDER TO SOCIALISE. MRS ~~ FEELS THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT MRS ~~ NEPHEW'S WIFE FEELS HAPPY TO COOK HOT MEALS AND DOES NOT AS THOUGH SHE IS 'BURNING OUT' SHE WOULD LIKE SOME SOCIAL SERVICES INPUT IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. ONE MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION MRS ~~ WAS SLIGHTLY DISHEVELLED BUT SEEMED TO HAVE GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE. SHE DESCRIBED HER MOOD AS 'FINE FOR HER AGE' ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT SHE WAS MILDLY LOW BUT WITH A RESPONSIVE AFFECT. THERE WERE NO PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS AT ALL. REGARDING SUICIDE$ SHE STATED THAT SHE COULD 'NEVER HURT HER FAMILY BY DOING THIS'$ SHE HAD NO PLANS AT ALL. ON MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION MRS ~~ SCORED 16/30 AND THIS IS AN IDENTICAL SCORE TO THE LAST ONE THAT WE TOOK AT THE NEW PATIENT APPOINTMENT. IMPRESSION MY IMPRESSION IS THAT MRS ~~ IS SUFFERING FROM A DEMENTING PROCESS AND SHE IS WAITING FOR AN APPOINTMENT AT THE ~~ CLINIC IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIAGNOSIS THIS. I DO NOT FEEL THAT SHE HAS ANY BIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM AN ANTIDEPRESSANT ALTHOUGH SHE DOES SEEM TO SUFFER FROM ISOLATION. MANAGEMENT PLAN 1. MRS ~~ IS STILL AWAITING AN APPOINTMENT AT THE ~~ CLINIC$ ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD TRY TO EXPEDITE THIS. 2. I WILL CHASE UP THE SOCIAL SERVICES REFERRAL AS THEY NEED TO ASSESS HER LIVING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RESPITE FOR THE CARERS. 3. WE WILL ARRANGE FOR A FURTHER FOLLOW UP IN APPROXIMATELY 4 MONTHS TIME AFTER THE ~  CLINIC APPOINTMENT ALTHOUGH IF YOU FEEL THAT WE NEED TO SEE HER MORE URGENTLY$ PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT US.

TP12790,4758519,#Incoming mail,MR ~~ UNIT~ HOSPITAL 09/02/09 MANY THANKS FOR RE-REFERRING MR ~ TO THE TEAM FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF HIS MEMORY PROBLEMS FOLLOWING MIXED REPORTS OVER HIS FUNCTIONING. I VISITED MR ~ ON THE 9TH FEBRUARY 2009. MR ~ WAS STILL IN HIS DRESSING GOWN WHEN I VISITED$ BUT I IE DIDN'T RECOGNISE ME OR REMEMBER ME VISITING TO ASSESS HIM IN THE PAST. HE WAS ABLE TO TELL ME HE WAS ON A REDUCING REGIME OF HIS EYE DROPS$ BUT ON CLOSER QUESTIONING SEEMED VAGU ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS. HOWEVER HE REFERRED TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SHEET. H DESCRIBED HIS MEMORY AS BEING OK$ AND STATED HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FORGETFUL. IT WAS STRANGE TO NOTE HE INITIALLY TOLD ME HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY MEDICATION$ AND WAS PHYSICALLY FIT OTHER THAN HIS KNEE FROM A SPORTING INJURY. WHEN ASKING HIM LATER HE TOLD ME HE WAS ON MEDICATION$ BUT WASN'T SURE WHAT IT WAS FOR. HE LATER DISCLOSED HE HAD TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FINGERS$ WITH SOME LOSS OF FEELING. HE REPORTS HE IS EATING AND SLEEPING WELL$ AND HAS NO WORRIES. I CARRIED OUT AN ACE TEST AND HE WAS FULLY ORIENTATED TO TIME$ DATE$ PLACE$ SCORED WELL WITH ATTENTION / CONCENTRATION 5/5$ BUT SCORED 0/3 ON SHORT TERM RECALL. HE WAS UNABLE TO NAME THE PRIME MINISTER BUT KNEW HE WAS ~$ BUT COULD RECALL ~~. HE WAS ALSO UNABLE TO NAME THE PAST$ AND PRESENT PRESIDENT OF THE USA. THERE WAS A SLIGHT DETERIORATION IN HIS VERBAL FLUENCY FROM HIS LAST TEST IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR. HE LOST POINTS FOR LANGUAGE$ AND WAS UNABLE TO RECALL ONE OF THE PICTURES. HE ALSO DETERIORATED IN HIS OVERALL MEMORY AS HE WAS UNABLE TO REMEMBER ANY OF THE ADDRESS AT THE START OF THE TEST$ EVEN WITH PROMPTING OF THE POSSIBLE ANSWERS. HIS OVERALL SCORES WERE 24/30 MMSE WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS LAST YEAR$ BUT HE HAD DETERIORATED FROM 73 TO 66 ON THE ACE. APPARENTLY HE STILL DRIVES TO THE ~ AND ~ CLUB$ AND HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF A:; ENJOYING THE OUTDOORS WITH ATTENDING HOUND TRAILS ETC. HE DID SOUND REPETITIVE IN SPEECH AT TIMES$ ASKING THE SAME QUESTION. IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE HE WAS UNABLE TO TELL ME HIS SON'S PHONE NUMBER IN ~ OR EVEN FIND IT IN HIS TELEPHONE DIRECTORY.

THERE WERE NO OTHER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS AT THAT TIME. WHEN SHE HAD THE STENT PUT IN HOWEVER SHE WAS CLEARLY CONFUSED AND WANDERING IN THE WARD. THE STAFF ON THE WARD CALLED HER HUSBAND AT LAM AND AT 5AM AND WHEN HE CAME IN SHE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISE HIM. HER HUSBAND SPOKE TO THE CARDIOLOGIST DR ~ AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT POSSIBLY TO BE A STROKE RESULTING FROM THE PROCEDURE$ THE CT SCAN WAS NORMAL. THE HUSBAND WAS TOLD) HER MENTAL STATE MIGHT BE A REACTION TO THE DYE USED IN THE PROCEDURE. THE HUSBAND COULD NOT IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH MEMORY OR OTHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE. HE DID SAY HE FELT THAT SHE HAD POSSIBLY DETERIORATED A LITTLE DURING THE PAST 6 MONTHS ALTHOUGH SOME DAYS WERE BETTER THAN OTHERS. SHE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN DOING THINGS FOR HERSELF; EVEN TO THE EXTENT SHE IS AFRAID SHE CANNOT CROSS THE ROAD UNAIDED. HER HUSBAND HAS TAKEN OVER THE COOKING AND MOST THE CLEANING IN THE LAST 8 YEARS SINCE THEY BOTH RETIRED AND SHE DOES LESS AND LESS IN THE HOME$ SHE CLEARLY DEPENDS ON HIM A GREAT DEAL. HE DESCRIBED SAME SPATIAL DISORIENTATION IN THE HOUSE WHERE SHE COULD LOSE HER WAY. SHE IS UNDERSTANDABLY WORRIED THAT SHE CANNOT COPE WITHOUT HER HUSBAND'S SUPPORT$ INDEED THE MORNING WHEN I VISITED HER HUSBAND HAD HAD AN APPOINTMENT IN ~ FOR HIS KNEE AND SHE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS ABOUT BEING IN THE HOUSE BY HERSELF. SHE ALSO HAS DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING PEOPLE'S NAMES SUCH AS THE GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN AND GETS FRUSTRATED AND DISTRESSED AND OCCASIONALLY UPSET BY THIS. SHE IS NEVER PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED HOWEVER AND STILL MANAGES TO ENJOY LIFE$ PARTICULARLY CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY AND HER HUSBAND'S COMPANY AND ALSO WATCHING THE TELEVISION. IN ADDITION TO HER MEDICATION FOR PHYSICAL CONDITIONS$ SHE HAS BEEN TAKING TEMAZEPAM FOR ABOUT A YEAR. UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WAS TAKING 10MG WHEN SHE WENT TO BED AND A FURTHER 10MG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IF SHE AWOKE. HER HUSBAND HAS CUT HER DOWN TO TAKING ONLY AN ADDITIONAL 5MG OCCASIONALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE 10MG WHICH SHE TAKES WHEN SHE GOES TO BED. HE WONDERED WHETHER TEMAZEPAM MIGHT BE CONTRIBUTING TO HER CONFUSION. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO TRY AND GRADUALLY REDUCE THE TEMAZEPAM$ IF THIS IS POSSIBLE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME$ AND EVEN DISCONTINUE IT IF THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED. AS YOU MENTIONED SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ANXIOUS PERSON$ AS WAS HER FATHER$ ALTHOUGH THIS NEVER LIMITED HER SUBSTANTIALLY EARLIER IN LIFE. SHE WORKED IN A LOCAL SHOPLFOR 31 YEARS AND AFTER RETIREMENT SHE AND HER HUSBAND HELPED TO LOOK AFTER GREAT GRANDCHILDREN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF CHECKING THINGS VERY THOROUGHLY AND EVEN NOW CHECKS ALL THE DOORS AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE SHE GOES TO BED AND OCCASIONALLY WILL GET UP AND CHECK THEM AGAIN. I DID NOT GET THE IMPRESSION HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS A VERY INTRUSIVE FACTOR IN HER LIFE. THEY BOTH SAID THAT THE LAST 2 YEARS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WITH A SUCCESSION OF ILLNESSES IN THE HUSBAND$ FAMILY EVENTS AND HER HEALTH PROBLEMS. AS YOU WILL:*OBABLY BE AWARE THE HUSBAND HAD A HEART ATTACK$ A NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL KNEE REPLACEMENT$ A FALL WHERE HE CUT HIS HAND AND HAD TO HAVE STITCHES$ A GASTRIC BLEED SECONDARY TO ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS IN ADDITION TO ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE HAS HAD. THEY HAVE A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY WITH 2 DAUGHTERS WHO LIVE LOCALLY$ 4 GRANDCHILDREN $AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. ONE OF GRANDCHILDREN HAS RECENTLY EMIGRATED TO ~$ HAVING PREVIOUSLY WON A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON THE LOTTERY. THEY ALSO HAVE SUPPORT FROM MR ~ SISTER WHO WAS WIDOWED AND LIVES LOCALLY. THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 57 YEARS. MRS ~ DOES NOT SMOKE OR DRINK ALCOHOL. AT INTERVIEW SHE WAS SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS AND SOMEWHAT HESITANT BUT SMART$ PLEASANT$ CO OPERATIVE AND ABLE TO RELATE WELL AT A SOCIAL LEVEL. SHE WAS CHEERFUL AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MILD DYSPHASIA IT DID NOT INTERFERE SUBSTANTIALLY WITH COMMUNICATION. ON COGNITIVE TESTING SHE SCORED 16/30 ON MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION AND ON OTHER TESTING SHE HAD SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES WITH FRONTAL LOBE (EXECUTIVE FUNCTION). SHE HAS: SIGNIFICANT DYSPRAXIA AND A MILD DEGREE OF NOMINAL DYSPHASIA. AS FAR AS DIAGNOSIS IS CONCERNED I THINK THIS IS MOST LIKELY TO REPRESENT A GENERALISED VASCULAR DEMENTIA ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE THERE IS A ALSO A COMPONENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. ALTHOUGH I WILL LOOK INTO WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DYE USED IN THE PROCEDURE MIGHT HAVE HAD AN EFFECT$ I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS. I WILL LOOK AT THE GENERAL NOTES TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I CAN GAIN FURTHER FROM THIS$ AND INDEED HAVE A FURTHER LOOK AT THE CT BRAIN SCAN. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE LOOKING FOR OBVIOUS STROKE DISEASE$ IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT SMALL VESSEL DISEASE OF A MORE DIFFUSE NATURE WHICH ACCOUNT FOR HER SYMPTOMS. I HAVE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT I DID NOT THINK THAT THERE WAS ANY NEED FOR ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL$ WHICH GREATLY RELIEVED HER. SHE WAS CLEARLY QUITE ANXIOUS BUT MY EXPLANATION OF HER SYMPTOMS WAS THAT IT WAS LIKELY THAT AT SOME TIME DURING OR AROUND THE STENT BEING PUT IN THERE HAD BEEN PRE-EXISTING POOR CIRCULATION IN THE BRAIN BUT THIS WAS REVEALED RATHER THAN CAUSED BY THE PROCEDURE$ DESCRIBING IT AS 'THE STRAW WHICH BREAKS THE CAMELS BACK'. NEITHER MRS ~ NOR HER HUSBAND WANTED ANY FURTHER INTERVENTION AT THE PRESENT TIME AND I DO NOT THINK ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION WOULD HELP IN HER FUTURE MANAGEMENT. IF HE HAD BEEN ASKING FOR SOME ONGOING SUPPORT THEN IT WOULD BE REASONABLE' TO THINK OF THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH NURSE BEING INVOLVED$ BUT I THINK THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS WOULD DESTABILISE THE SITUATION RATHER THAN SUPPORT IT. I WOULD THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT YOU KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE SITUATION YOURSELF AS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING AND MAKE AN EARLY REFERRAL BACK TO THE SERVICE SHOULD THERE BE A SITUATION WHERE MORE SUPPORT IS NEEDED. IN PARTICULAR I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD MANAGE WITHOUT HER HUSBAND'S SUPPORT ALTHOUGH I WOULD ANTICIPATE THERE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL OF FAMILY SUPPORT AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN IF THERE IS ANYTHING FURTHER I CAN ADD ONCE I HAVE HAD A MORE CAREFUL LOOK AT HER ~ GENERAL HOSPITAL NOTES. PS I HAVE NOW OBTAINED THE ~ GENERAL HOSPITAL CARDIAC NOTES.'$ WHILST THE CT SCAN EXCLUDES A MAJOR STROKE IT WOULD NOT EXCLUDE GENERALISED CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASE OR ALZHEIMERS DISEASE. IT SEEMS THAT SHE HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO THE DYE ON BOTH OCCASIONS$ CAUSING A MARKED ERYTHEMA FOR WHICH SHE WAS TREATED WITH HYDROCORTISONE AND ANTIHISTAMINE. THERE IS NO MENTION HOWEVER OF ANY LIKELIHOOD OR SUGGESTION THAT THE DYE MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. THE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT SHE HAD MILD UNDERLYING COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND THE STRESS OF BEING IN HOSPITAL$ THE PROCEDURE AND BEING UNWELL WITH AN ALLERGIC REACTION PRECIPITATED THE DETERIORATION$ RATHER THAN CAUSING COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. I THINK GIVEN THIS FURTHER INFORMATION IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT FURTHER GRADUAL DETERIORATION EITHER AS A RESULT OF EXISTING CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASE OR THE POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL ALZHEIMERS DISEASE.,free text,117,16,WITH HER HUSBAND,family member closely involved in pt's care,,

TP12941,4790541,#Letter from specialist,DR ~~ OLDER PERSONS MENTAL HEALTH ~~ HOSPITAL 28/04/06 THANK YOU FOR REFERRING MRS ~ WHO I SAW ON ~~ BEHALF AT HOME WITH HER HUSBAND ON 27/04/2006. HER HUSBAND DESCRIBED HOW SHE HAD AN ANGIOGRAN$ AND AT THE SAME TIME HER MEDICATION CHANGE RESULTED IN WHAT I PRESUME TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DRUG ALLERGY WHEN HER WHOLE BODY SKIN TURNED RED. THERE WERE NO OTHER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS AT THAT TIME. WHEN SHE HAD THE STENT PUT IN HOWEVER SHE WAS CLEARLY CONFUSED AND WANDERING IN THE WARD. THE STAFF ON THE WARD CALLED HER HUSBAND AT LAM AND AT 5AM AND WHEN HE CAME IN SHE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISE HIM. HER HUSBAND SPOKE TO THE CARDIOLOGIST DR ~ AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT POSSIBLY TO BE A STROKE RESULTING FROM THE PROCEDURE$ THE CT SCAN WAS NORMAL. THE HUSBAND WAS TOLD) HER MENTAL STATE MIGHT BE A REACTION TO THE DYE USED IN THE PROCEDURE. THE HUSBAND COULD NOT IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH MEMORY OR OTHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE. HE DID SAY HE FELT THAT SHE HAD POSSIBLY DETERIORATED A LITTLE DURING THE PAST 6 MONTHS ALTHOUGH SOME DAYS WERE BETTER THAN OTHERS. SHE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN DOING THINGS FOR HERSELF; EVEN TO THE EXTENT SHE IS AFRAID SHE CANNOT CROSS THE ROAD UNAIDED. HER HUSBAND HAS TAKEN OVER THE COOKING AND MOST THE CLEANING IN THE LAST 8 YEARS SINCE THEY BOTH RETIRED AND SHE DOES LESS AND LESS IN THE HOME$ SHE CLEARLY DEPENDS ON HIM A GREAT DEAL. HE DESCRIBED SAME SPATIAL DISORIENTATION IN THE HOUSE WHERE SHE COULD LOSE HER WAY. SHE IS UNDERSTANDABLY WORRIED THAT SHE CANNOT COPE WITHOUT HER HUSBAND'S SUPPORT$ INDEED THE MORNING WHEN I VISITED HER HUSBAND HAD HAD AN APPOINTMENT IN ~ FOR HIS KNEE AND SHE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS ABOUT BEING IN THE HOUSE BY HERSELF. SHE ALSO HAS DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING PEOPLE'S NAMES SUCH AS THE GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN AND GETS FRUSTRATED AND DISTRESSED AND OCCASIONALLY UPSET BY THIS. SHE IS NEVER PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED HOWEVER AND STILL MANAGES TO ENJOY LIFE$ PARTICULARLY CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY AND HER HUSBAND'S COMPANY AND ALSO WATCHING THE TELEVISION. IN ADDITION TO HER MEDICATION FOR PHYSICAL CONDITIONS$ SHE HAS BEEN TAKING TEMAZEPAM FOR ABOUT A YEAR. UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WAS TAKING 10MG WHEN SHE WENT TO BED AND A FURTHER 10MG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IF SHE AWOKE. HER HUSBAND HAS CUT HER DOWN TO TAKING ONLY AN ADDITIONAL 5MG OCCASIONALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE 10MG WHICH SHE TAKES WHEN SHE GOES TO BED. HE WONDERED WHETHER TEMAZEPAM MIGHT BE CONTRIBUTING TO HER CONFUSION. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO TRY AND GRADUALLY REDUCE THE TEMAZEPAM$ IF THIS IS POSSIBLE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME$ AND EVEN DISCONTINUE IT IF THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED. AS YOU MENTIONED SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ANXIOUS PERSON$ AS WAS HER FATHER$ ALTHOUGH THIS NEVER LIMITED HER SUBSTANTIALLY EARLIER IN LIFE.

TP12959,5233339,#Senile/presenile dementia,JAN032001~~~~ - 21 5 10. ~ IS A 91 YEAR OLD WIDOWER WHOM I SAW ON A DOMICILIARY VISIT ON THE 28 DECEMBER 2001. I OBTAINED SOME COLLATERAL HISTORY FROM THE NURSE IN CHARGE OF ~. I UNDERSTAND THAT MR ~ HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN LIVING ALONE WITH CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FROM HIS SEVEN CHILDREN. AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER HE DEVELOPED A CHEST INFECTION WHEN HE WENT 'OFF HIS LEGS'. HE WAS SEEN BY ONE OF HIS GPS AND ADMITTED TO A NURSING HOME FOR RESPITE. HE WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON THE 27 NOVEMBER BY WHICH TIME HE WAS BACK ON HIS FEET. HIS FAMILY WERE UNABLE TO COPE AND HE WAS READMITTED FOR RESPITE BY THE RATS TEAM TO ~ ON THE 1 DECEMBER. AT THIS POINT HIS FAMILY STATED THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND WANTED HIM TO REMAIN IN PERMANENT CARE. I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS HAD SOME COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DEVELOPING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS$ ALTHOUGH DETAILS OF THIS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ME. SINCE BEING IN ~~ HE HAS REQUIRED ASSISTANCE WITH HIS SELF-CARE BUT IS FREQUENTLY RESISTIVE. HE BECOMES UNSETTLED FROM LUNCH TIME ONWARDS WHEN HE BEGINS TO ASK TO GO HOME AND TRIES TO GET OUT OF ~ WHICH REQUIRES STAFF REPEATEDLY TO BRING HIM BACK. HE IS PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE AT TIMES AND SHOUTS OUT. MR ~ HAS BEEN UNABLE TO RETAIN INFORMATION FOR MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS. HE IS NOW MOBILE AND I UNDERSTAND HAS RECENTLY BEEN SEEN BY DR ~ WHO FOUND NO PHYSICAL CAUSE FOR HIS SYMPTOMS. MR ~ IS DISTURBED AT NIGHT WHEN HE WILL GET UP AND WANDER AROUND ~. HIS APPETITE IS REASONABLE IF HE CAN BE SETTLED THROUGH MEAL TIMES. WHEN MR ~ FAMILY VISIT HE IS VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE WITH THEM. MR ~HAD BEEN SEEN BY DR ~ ON THE DAY PRIOR TO MY VISIT AND GIVEN DIAZEPAM 5 MG STAT WHICH HAD SETTLED HIM DOWN. I HAVE NO INFORMATION REGARDING MR ~ MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY OR HIS PERSONAL HISTORY. HIS MEDICATION AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT WAS TRAMADOL PRN. ON MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT MR ~ WAS AN INDEPENDENTLY MOBILE$ UNSHAVEN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. HE WAS CO-OPERATIVE WITH MY INTERVIEW AND DURING MY VISIT THERE WAS NO OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF PSYCHOMOTOR AGITATION OR RETARDATION. THERE WAS SOME HEARING IMPAIRMENT EVIDENT BUT COMMUNICATION WAS NO PROBLEM. MR ~ SPEECH WAS SPONTANEOUS AND OF NORMAL FORM. THERE WAS NO OVERT DYSPHASIA BUT SOME REPETITIVENESS. HIS MOOD WAS EUTHYMIC AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT. I ELICITED NO DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS. ON COGNITIVE TESTING MR ~  WAS DISORIENTATED TO TIME AND PLACE AND ALTHOUGH ABLE TO REGISTER INFORMATION HAD NO RECALL AFTER A FEW MOMENTS. HE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF RECENT EVENTS AND COULD NOT REMEMBER ANY PROBLEMS. MR ~ COULD NOT REMEMBER HIS HOME ADDRESS AND WAS UNSURE HOW LONG HE HAD LIVED AT ~. HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME HIS CORRECT AGE AND DATE OF BIRTH. HE HAD NO INSIGHT INTO HIS CONDITION OR SITUATION. AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT MR ~ TOLD ME THAT HE WAS WELL LOOKED AFTER WHERE HE WAS AND WAS HAPPY TO STAY THERE. IN SUMMARY MR ~  IS A 91 YEAR OLD WIDOWER WITH DEMENTIA ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN THE MODERATE TO SEVERE RANGE BEHAVIOURAL DISTURBANCE. I HAVE COMMENCED HIM ON RISPERIDONE 0.5 MG ONCE DAILY AND WILL ASK DR ~ STAFF GRADE TO REVIEW HIM IN THE WEEK BEGINNING THE 31 DECEMBER. I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT MR ~ MAY REQUIRE PERMANENT CARE IN AN EMI HOME.,read term,,,#Senile/presenile dementia,,,

ON FURTHER QUESTIONING THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN HIS BIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS. HE HAS GOT AN EXTENSIVE RNEDICAI HISTORY AND A LONG LIST OF MEDICATION INCLUDING ANTI-THRUMBOTIC AGENTS. HE IS ALSO AN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC. HIS BACKGROUND INFORMATION INCLUDES THAT HE WORKED AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER ALL HIS LIFE. SINCE WIDOWED HE HAS MOVED TO LIVE WITH HIS SON ~$ FROM ~.

HE IS USUALLY CONTINENT; HOWEVER$ SON REPORTED SOME URINARY INCONTINENCE DURING UTI AND MORE ON ACUTE THEN CHRONIC STATE. THE MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION REVEALED A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS WELL KEMPT AND WELL DRESSED. I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP A GOOD RAPPORT. HE HAD EXTREMELY GOOD EYE CONTACT. THERE WERE NO ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS. HIS SPEECH WAS NORMAL IN RATE AND RHYTHM WITH GAPS IN SHORT-TERM MEMORY. HE ONLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT HE MANAGED TO REMEMBER. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF BIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. NO EVIDENCE OF PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. I PERFORMED A DETAILED COGNITIVE EXAMINATION$ WHERE HIS ORIENTATION TO TIME WAS 1/5$ PLACE WAS 3/5$ HE WAS ABLE TO REGISTER ALL THREE OBJECTS$ HIS ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION WAS GOOD$ PARTICULARLY GOING THROUGH THE DAYS OF THE WEEK BACKWARDS$ RECALL WAS 0/3.
