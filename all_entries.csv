MRS ~ COMPLAINS OF PAIN IN BOTH HER LEGS MAINLY AT NIGHT TIME ALTHOUGH SHE SAYS THIS COMES AND GOES. THIS PAIN IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH WALKING AS HER MOBILITY IS VERY POOR AND SHE IS ONLY ABLE TO WALK WITH A FRAME AROUND THE HOUSE DUE TO OSTEOARTHRITIS. HER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDES HYPOTHYROIDISM$ TIAS$ OSTEOPOROSIS$ OSTEOARTHRITIS AND HYPERTENSIVE DISEASE. THERE IS NO HISTORY OF DIABETES. HER MEDICATION INCLUDES CO- CODAMOL$ LEVOTHYROXINE$ ASPIRIN$ NAFTIDROFYRYL OXALATE$ PERINDOPRIL$ RISEDRONATE SODIUM$ FUROSEMIDE AND FERROUS SULPHATE. ON EXAMINATION SHE WAS VERY FRAIL AND SHE WAS UNABLE TO LIE DOWN DUE TO BREATHLESSNESS. I WAS ABLE TO PALPATE BOTH HER FEMORAL PULSES QUITE EASILY ALTHOUGH I WAS UNABLE TO PALPATE ANY PULSES BELOW THIS. BOTH HER FEET WERE WARM TODAY AND CAPILLARY REFILL IN BOTH FEET WAS SLUGGISH. I NOTE THAT THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE OF OSTEOARTHRITIS MAINLY AFFECTING HER RIGHT ANKLE AND THERE IS ALSO VENOUS FLARES PRESENT ON BOTH LEGS. WITH THE HAND HELD DOPPLER ANKLE BRACHIAL PRESSURE INDEX ON THE RIGHT WAS 0.54 AND ON THE LEFT WAS 0.84. THEREFORE THIS LADY I SUSPECT HAS SOME DEGREE OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ALTHOUGH I AM UNSURE WHETHER THIS IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF HER PAIN AS THIS IS ALSO COMPLICATED FROM OSTEOARTHRITIS. ON SPEAKING TO MR ~ WE FEEL THAT MRS ~ IS TOO FRAIL TO UNDERGO ANY INVESTIGATIONS OR INTERVENTION AT THE PRESENT TIME. I NOTE THAT SHE HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED CO- CODAMOL ALTHOUGH SHE TELLS ME THAT SHE DOES NOT TAKE THEM BECAUSE SHE FEELS SHE TAKES TOO MANY TABLETS. I HAVE ADVISED HER TO TAKE THE TABLETS THAT SHE HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED FOR THE PAIN AS THIS WILL HELP. WE PLAN TO REVIEW HER AGAIN IN 6 MONTHS TIME TO SEE HOW SHE IS GETTING ON. HOWEVER$ I DOUBT AT THIS STAGE WHETHER WE WILL BE OFFERING HER ANY FORM OF SURGERY.

SHE WAS SEEN AT THE ~ CLINIC APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AGO BECAUSE HER DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN WORRIED ABOUT HER MEMORY. AT THE TIME SHE HAD A GOOD MMSE SCORE AND VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE TO HER DAUGHTERS ABOUT A PACKAGE OF SOCIAL CARE THAT COULD HELP HER TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF INCLUDING DOSSET BOXES FOR HER MEDICATION. OVER RECENT MONTHS HER DAUGHTERS HAVE BOTH CONSULTED ME BECAUSE OF INCREASING CONCERNS ABOUT HER MEMORY. I SAW MRS ~ FOR ASSESSMENT HAVING ARRANGED HER BLOOD TESTS ALL OF WHICH WERE NORMAL. SHE HERSELF FEELS HER MEMORY IS NOT TOO BAD AND SAID SHE BECOMES INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS THAT HER DAUGHTERS WILL THINK IT IS BAD AND FEELS THIS MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE. ON EXAMINATION TODAY SHE WAS GENERALLY WELL. SHE HAS A PAST HISTORY OF A STROKE AND DOES OCCASIONALLY GET DIZZY. HER MMSE SCORE WAS 27/30. THE ONLY ONE SHE WAS UNABLE TO DO WAS MEMORIZING THE THREE OBJECTS. SHE DOES NOT GIVE ANY EVIDENCE OF DEPRESSION BUT I DID WONDER IF HER ANXIETY MIGHT BE INTERFERING WITH HER MEMORY. I SUGGESTED I WOULD LIKE TO REFER HER TO YOU TO SEE IF YOU HAD ANY SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW WE CAN HELP HER. THE RELEVANT LETTER FROM THE MEMORY CLINIC IS IN HER VISION NOTES.

WHILE I WAS THERE MR ~ ~$ A SOLICITOR FROM ~ ~$ SOLICITORS ARRIVED$ AT THE REQUEST OF ~ ~ TO ASSESS MRS ~'S CAPACITY TO CHANGE HER ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY. MRS ~ IS AN 83 YEAR OLD WOMAN$ WHO HAS LIVED IN ~ SINCE 1983. SHE WAS WIDOWED AROUND 1986. SHE HAS A SON IN ~ AND A STEPDAUGHTER FROM HER SECOND MARRIAGE IN ~. MRS ~ DOES HAVE A HISTORY OF SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. THIS CAME TO ATTENTION WHEN MRS ~'S SON VISITED FROM ~. SHE SAID THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED MRS ~ MOVING INTO ~ ACCOMMODATION. HOWEVER$ SHE SAID SHE WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE CAME HOME ONE AFTERNOON AND FOUND A 'FOR SALE' SIGN IN FRONT OF THE HOME. SHE SAID SHE DID NOT WISH TO GO TO ~ AS SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP ONE OF HER TWO DOGS. SHE SAID SHE WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT HER SON'S BEHAVIOUR AND THAT THIS HAD LED TO A BREAKDOWN IN HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS SHE NO LONGER WANTED HER SON TO HAVE ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY. MRS ~ TOLD ME SHE HAS MEALS ON WHEELS DELIVERED AND HAS A CLEANER ONCE PER WEEK. SHE KEEPS A NOTEBOOK WITH ALL HER APPOINTMENTS IN IT. SHE DOES NOT TAKE ANY REGULAR MEDICATIONS. SHE SAYS SHE SLEEPS IN THE AFTERNOON BUT IS OFTEN AWAKE AT 5:00A.M. SHE IS NOT DEPRESSED AT THIS TIME. HER APPETITE HAS BEEN STABLE$ ALTHOUGH HER WEIGHT HAS REDUCED. SHE HAS BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER SON. MRS ~ FELL A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO MY VISIT WHILE WALKING HER DOGS AND HAD 2 BLACK EYES. THERE IS NO PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY. ON INTERVIEW MRS ~ WAS MILDLY DISHEVELLED AND HAD 2 BLACK EYES. HER AFFECT WAS EUTHYMIC$ REACTIVE AND APPROPRIATE. HER STREAM AND FORM OF THOUGHT WERE NORMAL AND SHE HAD NO DELUSIONS. THERE WERE NO PERCEPTUAL DISTURBANCES AND NO SUICIDAL IDEATION OR PLANNING. SHE SCORED 28 OUT OF 30 ON MMSE. MRS ~ DID HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CHANGE HER ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY. SHE TOLD ME THAT AN ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY ALLOWED THE SOLICITOR TO TAKE OVER AND ARRANGE HER FINANCES AND SELLING OF THE HOUSE FOR HER. SHE SAID SHE WOULD PROBABLY BE GLAD TO HAVE SOMEONE DO THIS FOR HER PERMANENTLY IF SHE NO LONGER HAD THE CAPACITY TO DO SO. SHE WAS ABLE TO ASK APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AFTER READING THE DOCUMENT. THERE WAS NO COERCION TO CHANGE THE DOCUMENTATION. DIAGNOSIS: MRS ~ DOES HAVE MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. SHE DOES NOT CROSS THE THRESHOLD FOR A DIAGNOSIS OF DEMENTIA. OPINION: MRS ~ HAS CAPACITY TO REVOKE A PREVIOUS ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY. I WITNESSED HER SIGNATURE ON THE NEW FORM FOR ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY NAMING MR ~ ~ AS THE POWER OF ATTORNEY. I WOULD SUGGEST CONTINUING WITH THE MEALS ON WHEELS AND CLEANER. I HAVE NOT MADE ANY FURTHER APPOINTMENTS TO SEE MRS ~ BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO IF REQUESTED.

BRAIN CT-SCAN (11/07/2002) THERE IS MULTIFOCAL DEEP WHITE MATTER LOW DENSITY CHANGES IN THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES BILATERALLY. I THINK THIS IS SLIGHTLY MORE MARKED IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF MODEST GENERALISED CORTICAL INVOLUTION... CT FEATURES TO SUGGEST MULTIFOCAL ISCHAEMIC DISEASE. ASSESSMENT MRS.~ HAD SOME MEMORY OF SEEING ME IN 2002 AND I NOTED THAT HER WALKING WITH A ZF WAS EXTREMELY SLOW AND SHE GRIMACED WITH PAIN WHEN SHE SAT DOWN (REFERRING TO A FALL SHE HAD SUFFERED SOME WHILE AGO). DURING MY ASSESSMENT SHE SHOWED VARIABLE INSIGHT INTO HER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. SHE REPORTED THAT SHE HAD A HOME HELP THREE TIMES PER WEEK. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING SHOWED: 1. IMPAIRED SCORE ON THE 6-CIT DEMENTIA SCREENING TEST (SCORE = 16/28$ CUT OFF IS 7-8). 2. ATTENTION PROBLEMS WITH VERY MARKED SLOWNESS COUNTING 20-1 AND INABILITY TO COMPLETE MONTHS OF THE YEAR BACKWARDS. 3. MILD DISORIENTATION (10/12 IN I/O SCALE OF CAPE) INCLUDING TELLING ME THE MONTH WAS JUNE NOT MARCH (AND IN SPITE OF THE VERY COLD WEATHER). 4. IMPAIRED IMMEDIATE VERBAL MATERIAL (NAMES LEARNING TEST SCORE = 19/36 DISCONTINUED AFTER THREE TRIALS AS BELOW CUT-OFF POINT). 5. DYSEXECUTIVE SYNDROME; VERY MARKED IMPAIRMENT OF PHONOLOG CAL WORD FLUENCY (B PRORATED SCORE = 1X3 = 3 I. E. < 1'T %ILE; ANIMALS SCORE = 5$ I. E. 5 ' %ITE) ABNORMAL CLOCK FACE DRAWING WITH NUMBERING REVERSED AND STIMULUS BOUND EFFECT ON TIME PLACEMENT$ CONVERSE RESPONDING - REPEATED ERRORS$ MOTOR DYSPRAXIA ON FIST/EDGE/PALM SEQUENCE WITH SLOWNESS AND SOME ERRORS WHEN COPYING MODEL AND INCREASE IN ERRORS WHEN MODEL REMOVED. 6. IDEOMOTOR DYSPRAXIA WITH BODY PART AS OBJECT WHEN PANTOMIMING ACTIONS. CONCLUSIONS MRS. ~ IS SHOWING A VERYY DIFFERENT PICTURE TO THE PREVIOUS OCCASION OF TESTING (ON 6 H MAY 2002) WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. ALTHOUGH SHE IS ONLY MIL4LY DISORIENTATED$ SHE NOW HAS AN IMPAIRMENT OF IMMEDIATE VERBAL MEMORY$ WITH MARKED FEATURES OF DYSEXECUTIVE SYNDROME$ ATTENTION PROBLEMS AND AN IDEOMOTOR DYSPRAXIA. GIVEN THE BRAIN CT-SCAN OF JULY 2002 THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSTIC PICTURE IS OF A VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT THAT HAS QUICKLY PROGRESSED TO BECOME A VASCULAR DEMENTIA$ WHICH IS NOW MODERATE IN SEVERITY. 1. WHEN I WAS DISCUSSING MY FINDINGS WITH MRS.~  A FRIEND (FROM THE LOCAL - CHURCH) DRPPPED IN. SHE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT- MRS.-~ WAS NOT HEATING UP MEALS AND EATING RELIABLY (I.E. WITHOUT PROMPTING)$ EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NOW ARRANGED FOR HER TO GET ALTERNATIVE PRE-PREPARED MEALS (AS SHE DID NOT LIKE THE MEALS ON WHEELS). I NOTED FROM THIS THAT MRS.~ DOES NOT ALWAYS GIVE A RELIABLE ACCOUNT OF EVENTS. 2. I AGREED WITH MRS. ~ TO DISCUSS THINGS FURTHER WITH HER SON (~$ TELEPHONE ~). I TELEPHONED- HIM AND HE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS PHONING UP TO TWENTY TIMES A DAY AND THAT THEY HAD TO UNPLUG THE PHONE ON OCCASION TO COPE WITH THINGS. AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM IS THAT HER GRANDSON (WHO IS A DRUG USER) CONTINUES TO GO AROUND AND ASK FOR MONEY$ WHICH SHE APPARENTLY GIVES HIM. - - 3. IN TERMS OF RISKS MANAGEMENT I WILL BE MAKING -A REFERRAL TO SOCIAL SERVICES FOR A SOCIAL WORKER TO BE ALLOCATED TO: REVIEW HER HOME CARE AND PROVIDE DAILY HOME-CARE TO ENSURE THAT SHE PREPARES AND EATS AT LEAST TWO MEALS PER DAY.

THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION REGARDING HER MEDICATION AND SHE WAS ASKED TO BRING IN HER MEDICATION TO THIS CLINIC APPOINTMENT$ WHICH SADLY TO SAY$ SHE DID NOT. SHE DOES REPORT TAKING TWO TABLETS EVERY MORNING. MY INITIAL CONCERN WAS THAT SHE WAS TAKING 5MGS METHOTREXATE EVERY MORNING INSTEAD OF ONCE WEEKLY. ON REVIEW OF HER BLOOD RESULTS OF 19TH JUNE 2006$ INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ARE NORMAL$ AS ARE LIVER FUNCTION TESTS. HOWEVER$ IT IS STILL UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT MEDICATION SHE IS TAKING AND I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD SEND ME A LIST OF HER RECENT PRESCRIPTION. I FELT THAT IF SHE WAS TAKING HER METHOTREXATE DAILY$ SHE WOULD PRESENT FOR MORE TABLETS SOONER THAN REQUIRED AND HOPEFULLY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAGGED UP BY YOUR SYSTEM. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO WHETHER SHE HAS BEEN REQUESTING ANY OF HER MEDICATIONS EARLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PRESCRIBED. I HAVE ASKED HER TO BRING IN HER REPEAT PRESCRIPTION AND ALL THE MEDICATION THAT SHE IS TAKING. SHE STATES THAT SHE WILL DO THIS$ HOWEVER SHE WAS ASKED TO DO THIS AT HER LAST APPOINTMENT AND FAILED TO DO SO TODAY. SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER HUSBAND IN CLINIC BUT HE APPEARS TO BE AS CONFUSED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS SHE IS.

SHE SHOULD CURRENTLY BE ON METHOTREXATE 10MGS ONCE WEEKLY WITH FOLIC ACID 5MGS ONCE WEEKLY AS PROPHYLAXIS BUT I NOTE FROM OUR RECORDS THAT SHE REDUCED HER METHOTREXATE TO 5MGS ONCE WEEKLY IN SEPTEMBER 2005 AND NOW SHE TELLS ME SHE IS NOT TAKING ANYTHING AT ALL. SHE HAS DISCONTINUED HER METHOTREXATE AND SHE HAS DISCONTINUED HER FOLIC ACID AS WELL$ THE ONLY THING SHE IS TAKING IS CO-DYDRAMOL TWO IN THE MORNING AND OCCASIONALLY TWO AT NIGHT. HER JOINTS ARE FINE AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE DISEASE CLINICALLY OR SEROLOGICALLY AND I THINK FOR THE TIME BEING 1-THI4K WE SHOULD LEAVE HER OFF ANY DMARD. IF SHE DOES GET A FLARE I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS WITH HER DAUGHTER WHO WILL CONTACT ME AND I THINK THEN WE SHOULD CONSIDER SUBCUTANEOUS METHOTREXATE WHICH COULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DISTRICT NURSES.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ME WITH A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING A LIST OF HER CURRENT MEDICATION AS UNFORTUNATELY NONE WAS INCLUDED WITH YOUR ORIGINAL LETTER OF THE 11TH MAY 2006. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY NONE KNOWN.

PERSONAL HISTORY BORN IN ~$ WORKED I BELIEVE IN THE ~ BUSINESS UNTIL THE WAR AND THEN WENT ON TO DO WAR WORK SINCE WORKING IN THE ~ CLEARING BANK UNTIL THE BIRTH OF HER CHILDREN. SHE MET HER HUSBAND DURING THE WAR WHO WAS WORKING AS A ~ ENGINEER AND WHO LATTERLY WENT INTO THE ARMY FINALLY SERVING IN ~ POST WAR.

THEY MOVED TO ~ 25 YEARS AGO TO ~ AND THEN 13 YEARS AGO THEY MOVED TO ~. SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES LIVES WITH HER HUSBAND IN A SMALL WARDEN MANAGED FLAT AT THE TOP OF ~. BY HER OWN ADMISSION HER ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE CHAOTIC AS HER MEMORY PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME MORE APPARENT TO HER. INCREASINGLY THIS CAUSES SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION AND HER HUSBAND WHO IS OF A SIMILAR AGE WHO FEELS HE HAS SIMILAR PROBLEMS TENDS TO AGGRAVATE HER SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS HIS POOR MOOD AND SHORT TEMPER AND WHILST INTERRUPTING HER CONFUSES HER AND INCREASES THE CHAOTIC NATURE OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. BOTH OF THEM ADMIT THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS QUITE STRAINED. APPEARANCE & BEHAVIOUR AT INTERVIEW TODAY SHE WAS WELL PRESENTED WELL DRESSED HAD GOOD EYE CONTACT$ WAS SLIGHTLY SUSPICIOUS OF ME AND MY REASON FOR BEING THERE BUT DID SETTLE VERY WELL TO THE DISCUSSION AND ATTENDED VERY WELL TO ALL THAT WAS ASKED OF HER. SHE ADMITS TO BEING ANXIOUS AND PANICKY OR SLIGHTLY GREGARIOUS AND UNINHIBITED IN BEHAVIOUR. SPEECH SOME LOOSENING OF ASSOCIATION AND WORD FINDING DIFFICULTIES WERE EVIDENT TODAY SOMETHING WHICH SHE FEELS INCREASED HER LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION AND AGITATION AND IF PRESSURED MAKES QUITE PANICKY. MOOD SHE DOES REPORT BEING ANXIOUS AND PANICKY AT TIMES. OBJECTIVELY I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE AND NOTICEABLY INCREASES HER LEVEL OF BEHAVIOUR. CONCENTRATION POOR THOUGHTS PERHAPS BEST DESCRIBED AS BEING ANXIOUS AND PERPLEXED HAS BEEN MANAGING BY ROUTINE BUT INCREASINGLY NOW THIS IS BECOMING LESS POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH SHE DOES REFLECT THAT HER VARIABLE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT OF MEMORY DOES MEAN THAT SHE HAS BETTER TIMES THAN OTHERS. PERCEPTIONS HAS QUITE FIXED THOUGHTS THAT PEOPLE ARE AGAINST HER ALL OF WHICH I'M SURE ARE VERY VARIABLE IN NATURE AND DEGREE. BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND AGREE THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP CURRENTLY IS QUITE STRAINED AND DURING THE INTERVIEW WITH THEM BOTH AT TIMES WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING SHE WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN HERSELF IN THE DENIAL OF THE THINGS THAT HE WAS SAYING ABOUT HER LEVEL OF BEHAVIOUR$ ATTENTION$ CONCENTRATION$ ETC. BUT THEN 2 MINUTES LATER WOULD REPORT THE SAME FINDINGS. COGNITIVE I DID FORMALLY ASSESS HER USING THE MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION. SHE HAD GOOD ORIENTATION TO TIME AND REASONABLE TO PLACE. HER COMPREHENSION WAS POOR AND SHE SHOWED SOME SIGNIFICANT EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING DEFICITS. HER MINI MENTAL SCORE WAS 19/30. INSIGHT I THINK THIS IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AT PRESENT CERTAINLY IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING THINGS WITH THE HUSBAND I WOULD SAY SHE HAS NO INSIGHT AND NO AGREEMENT WITH HIM ABOUT ANY PROBLEMS THAT SHE HAS. WITH ME AND AT INTERVIEW TODAY SHE CLEARLY DID HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO HER CIRCUMSTANCES AND DESPITE TO ME THAT SHE WOULD BE NON COMPLIANT OF THINGS I MIGHT BE ASKING OF HER I FOUND HER TO BE QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND THE ONLY CONFRONTATION THAT OCCURRED WERE AT THE POINTS WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS INVOLVED IN DISCUSSION. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING CLEARLY BY HER OWN ADMISSION THINGS WITHIN SIDE THE HOME ARE BECOMING RATHER CHAOTIC BOTH OF THEM ARE CONCERNED AT HER ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM AS THEY GET OLDER. SHE IS BECOMING MORE ANXIOUS AND PANICKY WHILST TRYING TO COMPLETE TASKS AND CLEARLY RECOGNISES THAT SHE IS FORGETTING TO EVEN COMMENCE SOME. THERE IS SOME ELEMENT OF CONFABULATION WHICH RATHER CONFUSES THE PICTURE ABOUT WHAT HER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY REALLY IS BUT A REFLECTION OF THE HOME AND THE LETTER THAT YOU SENT TO ME IS FAIRLY DESCRIPTIVE OF THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE.

THE NATURE AND PATTERN OF THE ORIGINAL PROCESS APPEARS TO BE THAT SIMILAR TO THAT OF AN ALZHEIMER'S TYPE DEMENTIA BUT IN RECENT TIMES IT APPEARS THIS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE VARIABLE AND HAS INCREASED FROM TIME TO TIME. SHE DOES REPORT HAVING SMALL BLACKOUTS AND PERIODS OF VACANCIES AND MOST PROBABLY THEREFORE NOW THERE IS A VASCULAR COMPONENT TO THE PROBLEMS. CLEARLY BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE AT EACH OTHERS THROATS ON A REGULAR BASIS. MY FIRST THOUGHTS THEREFORE IS TO CREATE AN ELEMENT OF SEPARATION$ SHE DOES REASONABLY GOOD NETWORK OF FRIENDS FROM THE ~ CHURCH BUT I AM GOING TO ASK HER TO ATTEND THE DAY HOSPITAL AT ~~ ONCE A WEEK AND ASK SOCIAL SERVICES WITH SUPERVISION AND SUPPORT TO START SLOWLY PUTTING IN A CARE PACKAGE IN THE LATE MORNINGS TO HELP MONITOR AND SUPPORT THE HOME SITUATION.

AFTER A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT BY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM SHE HAD AN MRI SCAN AND AN ECG AND I SAW HER AT ~ ON THE 20TH JANUARY 2010 ALONG WITH HER DAUGHTER MRS ~. MRS ~ DESCRIBED SOME SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS. SHE TENDS TO MISPLACE KEYS ETC AND SOMETIMES LOSES TRACK OF CONVERSATIONS. MRS ~ HAD MENINGITIS AT THE AGO OF 8 MONTHS WHICH LEFT HER DEAF AND WITH POOR BALANCE. HER DAUGHTER THINKS SHE ALSO HAS SOME COORDINATION PROBLEMS AND SPATIAL DISORIENTATION AS A RESULT OF THE MENINGITIS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAVE NOTICED THAT HER COGNITIVE FUNCTION IS A LITTLE WORSE. SHE WAS ALSO THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HAVING TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS HOWEVER MORE RECENTLY IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THIS WAS DUE F.. TO POSTURAL HYPOTENSION AND SHE HAS HAD NO MORE EPISODES SINCE BEING PRESCRIBED MIDODRINE BY DOCTOR ~. SHE REMAINS INDEPENDENT FOR PERSONAL CARE. SHE ATTENDS ~~ DAY CENTRE ON ~ DURING THE WEEK WHERE SHE HAS LUNCH AND AT THE WEEKEND SHE ENJOYS VISITING ~ WHERE SHE HAS A HOT MEAL IN THE CAFE.

SHE MAY HAVE HAD SOME TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY 20 YEARS AGO BUT OTHERWISE HAS NO HISTORY OF MENTAL HEALTH DIFFICULTIES. IN HER PHYSICAL STATE APART FROM HAVING HAD MENINGITIS AND POSTURAL HYPOTENSION SHE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY WELL. SHE DOES NOT SMOKE AND DRINKS VERY LITTLE ALCOHOL. CURRENT MEDICATION IS ASPIRIN 75MG PER DAY$ OMEPRAZOLE 20MG PER DAY$ SIMVASTATIN 40MG PER DAY AND MIDODRINE. SHE DOES NOT DRIVE A CAR. MRS ~  IS ORIGINALLY FROM ~. MRS ~ WAS HAPPILY MARRIED BUT UNFORTUNATELY HER HUSBAND DIED SOME YEARS AGO. SHE HAS TWO DAUGHTERS AND A SON WHO VISIT REGULARLY. IN THE PAST SHE WORKED IN ~ AS A CLEANER. ON MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION SHE SCORED 24/30 BUT SHE WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE SOME OF THE TESTS BECAUSE OF HER VISUAL DIFFICULTIES. ON THE BRISTOL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING SCALE SHE SCORED 4/60 SUGGESTING THAT SHE IS STILL QUITE INDEPENDENT. MRI SCAN SHOWED DILATATION OF THE LATERAL AND 3 VENTRICLES WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO BE LONGSTANDING. THERE WAS A LITTLE SMALL VESSEL DISEASE IN THE PERIVENTRICULAR AREA AND THINNING OF THE CORTICAL MANTLE IN THE POSTERIOR PARIETAL AND OCCIPITAL REGION. MRS ~ DIFFICULTIES CONSTITUTE MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT ONLY AT PRESENT AND SHE DOES NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED DEMENTIA. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HER SYMPTOMS ARE DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE AGING BRAIN ON PRE-EXISTING DAMAGE DUE TO MENINGITIS. I EXPLAINED THIS TO MRS. ~ AND TO HER DAUGHTER AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD REVIEW MRS ~ IN SIX MONTHS TIME. WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF MRS ~ NOMINATING A LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR WELFARE AND FINANCE$ THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE AND THE NEED TO CONSIDER MAKING OR CHANGING A WILL IF SHE SO DESIRES. AS YOU KNOW HER DAUGHTER IS AN ADVOCATE FOR AGE CONCERN AND ALREADY HAS A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THESE ISSUES. I SHALL WRITE TO YOU AGAIN ONCE I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO REVIEW MRS ~. SHE AND HER FAMILY ARE OF COURSE WELCOME TO CONTACT THIS DEPARTMENT EARLIER IF THE SITUATION IS DETERIORATING.

HER SON ~ WAS PRESENT FOR THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OR SO OF THE APPOINTMENT. MRS ~ IS A 91 YEAR OLD WIDOW WHO LIVES ALONE. SHE DENIES ANY PROBLEMS BUT HER SON REPORTS THAT SHE IS FREQUENTLY CONFUSED. SHE OFTEN THINKS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE ESPECIALLY HER SON ~ WHO DIED 30 YEARS AGO. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS SHE BOTH KNOWS THAT HE DIED BUT ALSO SAYS THAT SHE OFTEN SEES HIM SITTING IN HER ARMCHAIR AND SEES NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THESE TWO FACTS. SHE ALSO BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE COME INTO HER HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT AND DISTURB THINGS. SHE REPORTEDLY RANG HER SON EARLY ONE MORNING RECENTLY SAYING THAT SHE'D FOUND THE ELECTRIC COOKER RING ON AND BELIEVED IT MUST HAVE BEEN TURNED ON BY A NOCTURNAL INTRUDER. ONE OF HER GRANDDAUGHTERS COMES IN TO CLEAN AND SHOP FOR HER AND SHE ACCUSES HER OF STEALING. SHE ALSO KNOCKS ON THE NEIGHBOURS DOOR LOOKING FOR HER GRANDDAUGHTER. THE NEIGHBOUR REPORTS THAT SHE HAS ONCE FOUND HER WANDERING OUTSIDE AT NIGHT LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. SHE HAS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS PHONED ~ DURING THE NIGHT THINKING IT WAS DAYTIME. IN SOME RESPECTS SHE CONTINUES TO MANAGE QUITE WELL. SHE WALKS INTO ~ EVERYDAY FOR A CUP OF TEA IN A CAFE AND HAS NOT YET GOT LOST. SHE GOES SHOPPING WITH HER FAMILY BUT CAN ALSO MANAGE TO BUY ONE OR TWO ITEMS ON HER OWN. SHE APPARENTLY STILL COOKS FOR HERSELF.

I UNDERSTAND THE CARER SOMETIMES HELPS HER WITH MORNING PERSONAL CARE AND BREAKFAST BUT OTHER DAYS SHE MANAGES THIS INDEPENDENTLY. THEIR SIX WEEK TIME LIMIT WILL SOON BE UP BUT ~~$ CARE MANAGER IS ARRANGING FOR A MORNING VISIT TO CONTINUE. PHYSICALLY SHE IS VERY WELL.

SHE WORKED IN DOMESTIC SERVICE ON A ~ WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS A ~. THEY HAD THREE SONS$ THE YOUNGEST OF WHOM DIED AGED 22. HER OLDER TWO SONS LIVE LOCALLY AND ARE IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THEIR MOTHER. ~ IS DISABLED BY PARKINSONS DISEASE. ON EXAMINATION SHE WAS A FIT LOOKING WOMAN. SHE WAS FULLY MOBILE WITH NO SIGNS OF PARKINSONISM. SHE WAS CLEANLY DRESSED$ FRIENDLY AND TALKATIVE. SUBJECTIVELY HER MOOD WAS GOOD AND SHE APPEARED EUTHYMIC WITH CHEERFUL AFFECT. HER SPEECH WAS NORMAL ALTHOUGH MEMORY IMPAIRMENT WAS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN CONVERSATION$ FOR EXAMPLE SHE CONFUSED HER SON WITH HER HUSBAND. I DID NOT ELICIT ANY PARANOID IDEAS AT INTERVIEW AND SHE WAS NOT ACTIVELY HALLUCINATING. SHE SCORED 16/30 ON THE MMSE AND PERFORMED VERY POORLY ON THE CLOX TEST. SHE IS NOT SEVERELY FUNCTIONALLY IMPAIRED WITH A MODIFIED BADLS SCORE OF 18. ALTHOUGH SHE QUITE OFTEN SAYS THAT SHE CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS SHE HAS NO REAL INSIGHT INTO HER DIFFICULTIES AND DOES NOT SEE THE NEED FOR ANY ADDITIONAL HELP. HOWEVER SHE DOES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTING THE DAILY CARER VISITS WITHOUT OBJECTION.

I THINK SHE IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A TRIAL OF A CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR AND WITH DAILY CARER VISITS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SUPERVISE ITS ADMINISTRATION.

HER COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS SELF-CARE HAVE DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY AND I BELIEVE SHE IS NOW REQUIRING CLOSE OBSERVATION AND CARE. IT HAS BEEN HOWEVER DIFFICULT TO DELIVER THIS CARE AND I UNDERSTAND FROM THE STAFF THAT HER TENDENCY TO PUSH STAFF HAS FEATURED RECENTLY ON A DAILY BASIS. SHE HAS ALSO TENDED TO SHOUT AND SCREAM AND HAS BEEN CALLING THE STAFF DIFFERENT NAMES OF LATE. MRS ~ MOBILITY AS WELL AS HER DAILY NEEDS HAVE DETERIORATED$ WHICH MEANT THAT ONE-TO-ONE CARE BE PROVIDED AT TIMES THOUGH DELIVERING IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT DUE TO HER RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT ANY CARE. HER PARKINSONS HAS I UNDERSTAND DETERIORATED AND WITH HER HISTORY OF CA BREAST I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT DEPOSITS COULD BE A POSSIBILITY AND CAN NEVER BE RULED OUT. I UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT SHE HAS REFUSED ANY INTERVENTION AND WITH THIS HER CARE WILL SUFFER. AT INTERVIEW SHE TRIED TO COOPERATE WITH THE HISTORY BUT WAS CLEARLY NOT QUITE CLEAR HOW. ALTHOUGH PLEASANT SHE FAILED TO RECOGNISE ~ WHERE SHE HAS LIVED FOR FIVE YEARS. SHE WAS ABLE TO TELL ME SOME OF HER BACKGROUND AT ~ BUT FAILED ON MORE RECENT MEMORY. HER MMSI4 SCORE WOULD BE WITHIN THE SEVERELY IMPAIRED. THIS PLEASANT LADY IS MANIFESTING THE BEHAVIOUR ASPECT OF HER DEMENTIA AND I AM OF THE OPINION THAT SHE MAY REQUIRE AN EMI REGISTERED ESTABLISHMENT OF NURSING ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS BASED ON HER MULTIPLE MEDICAL NEEDS AS WELL AS THE EMERGENCE OF THE DEMENTIA ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUE IN SOCIAL SERVICES WILL BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THIS.

POSSIBLE COMPONENT OF ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE THANK YOU FOR REFERRING THIS 88 YEAR OLD LADY WHO COMPLAINS OF A 3 YEAR HISTORY OF INCREASING SHORTNESS OF BREATH ON EXERTION. SHE DENIES EVER EXPERIENCING CHEST PAIN AND SUFFERS FROM NOTHING IN THE WAY OF ORTHOPNEA OR PND. SHE DOES SUFFER FROM A DEGREE OF ANKLE OEDEMA ALTHOUGH THIS OCCURS ONLY IN THE LATE AFTERNOON. SHE IS HOWEVER SHORT OF BREATH AFTER APPROXIMATELY 20 METRES OR ON THE STAIRS. MRS ~ ALSO DENIES PALPITATIONS OR ANY SYNCOPAL EPISODES. I NOTE THAT HER SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN OF GRADUAL ONSET AND RECENTLY WORSENED AROUND THE SAME TIME AS HER STEROIDS WERE INITIATED. SHE IS CURRENTLY MANAGING WELL AT HOME LIVING WITH HER FAMILY AND ON EXAMINATION TODAY IN CLINIC SHE WAS REASONABLY WELL WITH A PACED RATE OF 75BPM$ NORMAL BP$ A PANSYSTOLIC MURMUR AND A CLEAR CHEST AND NORMAL JVP. A RECENT ECHO REVEALS A MINOR GRADIENT ACROSS HER AORTIC VALVE OF 24MMHG AS WELL AS MILD AORTIC REGURGITATION. I HAVE TODAY DISCUSSED HER CASE WITH DR ~ WHO FEELS THAT MRS ~'S SHORTNESS OF BREATH IS UNLIKELY TO BE CARDIAC IN ORIGIN AND AS SUCH I HAVE TODAY DISCHARGED HER FROM THE CARDIOLOGY CLINIC. I HAVE ALSO REQUESTED SEVERAL BASELINE SIMPLE BLOOD TESTS SUCH AS HB AND THYROID FUNCTION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THESE REMAIN STABLE. I WILL ARRANGE FOR THE RESULTS TO BE FORWARDED TO YOUR SURGERY. SHOULD MRS ~ EXPERIENCE ANY FURTHER PROBLEMS THEN IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ASK OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDICINE FOR THE ELDERLY DEPARTMENT TO SEE HER.,9N1P.00,Seen in cardiac clinic,39755,39772,TN

TO ARGON PLASMA COAGULATE IT. THIS WOULD TAKE A LITTLE WHILE BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO AFFECT SOME KIND OF SYMPTOM CONTROL BUT IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY NOT GET RID OF THE TUMOUR. 3. DO NOTHING. 4. THE TUMOUR IS NOT REALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR FURTHER LOCAL EXCISION. AFTER CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION MRS ~ DECIDED THAT AT THE MOMENT HER SYMPTOMS DO NOT WARRANT ANY TREATMENT. SHE HAS RULED OUT ALTOGETHER AN ANTERIOR RESECTION WHICH I AM PLEASED ABOUT BUT I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE RUNS INTO PROBLEMS WITH SYMPTOM CONTROL WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE ARGON ABLATION POSSIBILITY. I TOLD HER I WOULD SEE HER AGAIN IN AROUND FOUR MONTHS IN OUT-PATIENTS TO SEE HOW SHE IS GETTING ON.

MANY THANKS FOR REFERRING THIS 74-YEAR-OLD RIGHT-HANDED LADY. SHE HAS HAD VISUAL PROBLEMS NOW FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS. SHE HAS A RATHER COMPLICATED PAST OPHTHALMIC HISTORY. I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE INITIALLY SAW MR ~ BECAUSE OF BILATERAL CATARACTS. SHE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH BASAL CELL CARCINOMA AROUND THE EYES AND HAS HAD TREATMENT ON THE RIGHT SIDE WITH CRYOTHERAPY AND ON THE LEFT SIDE WITH SURGERY. HE HAS ALSO HAD BILATERAL CATARACT OPERATIONS IN 2005 AND THEN ON THE LEFT SIDE IN 2006. THE HISTORY APPEARS TO BE PROGRESSIVE. THERE ARE NUMBER OF FEATURES IN THE HISTORY TODAY THAT WERE RATHER UNUSUAL. ~ CAN RECALL HAVING A DIFFICULTY SINGING HYMNS IN CHURCH. SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TRACT ACROSS LINES WHILST READING FROM THE HYMN SHEETS. HER HUSBAND SAYS THAT SHE IS ABLE TO READ TELETEXT ON THE TELEVISION FROM DISTANCE. SHE IS ALSO OCCASIONALLY ABLE TO PICK UP A SPECK OF DUST ON HIS CLOTHS AND BRUSH IT AWAY EVEN THOUGH HER FORMAL VISUAL ACUITIES ARE QUITE POOR. HER HUSBAND SAYS THAT HER SHORT-TERM MEMORY HAS BECOME A LITTLE IMPAIRED. FOR EXAMPLE SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THE APPOINTMENT TIME TODAY. IN ADDITION ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS SHE HAS BECOME DISORIENTATED AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND HER WAY OUT OF A ROOM. HER HUSBAND CONFIRMED TODAY THAT SHE WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE HER WAY OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT EVEN THOUGH HER FORMAL VISUAL ACUITY TODAY WAS NOT AS BAD AS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AND ALMOST CERTAINLY SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW NAVIGATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE IS ON STEROIDS FOR POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA. ON EXAMINATION TODAY THE VISUAL ACUITY IN THE BOTH EYES WAS 6/24. IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THE PATIENT FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE TARGET BEFORE CHECKING VISUAL ACUITY. WITH EVEN COMMENCE THE TASK. I THOUGHT BOTH OPTIC DISCS WERE SLIGHTLY PALE BUT PROBABLY NOT PATHOLOGICALLY SO. THE VISUAL FIELDS WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS. THERE WERE SOME INCONSISTENCIES BUT THERE DID APPEAR TO BE SOME INFERIOR TEMPORAL VISUAL FIELD LOSS IN THE RIGHT EYE AND PERHAPS SOME INFERIOR TEMPORAL FIELD LOSS IN THE LEFT EYE AS WELL. THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEFINITE VISUAL INATTENTION.. SHE WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE FEATURES OF A BEACH SCENE FROM A CARD BUT SHE DID FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PUT THE SCENE TOGETHER. SHE HAS THIS OBVIOUS CHANGE TO THE LEFT EYELID FROM SURGERY BUT NO LIMITATION IN EYE MOVEMENT. THE PUPIL REFLEXES WERE SLIGHTLY SLUGGISH AND THE ACCOMODATION REFLEX IN PARTICULAR WAS FAIRLY POOR. I DID NOT THINK THERE WERE ANY OTHER CRANIAL NERVE SIGNS. THE REFLEXES WERE SYMMETRIC WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ANKLE JERKS WHICH WERE ABSENT. THE PLANTAR RESPONSES ARE FLEXOR. THERE WERE NO CEREBELLAR SIGNS. I NOTE THAT THE MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN SHOWS SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE VENTRICLE. THE SCANS WERE SET UP PARTICULARLY TO LOOK AT THE PITUITARY GLAND. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF CHIASMAL COMPRESSION. I AM NOT SURE WHETHER THERE ARE PARTICULAR POSTERIOR CORTICAL CHANGES AND IT WOULD BE SENSIBLE TO HAVE THIS REVIEWED BY OUR SPECIALIST NEURORADIOLOGISTS. I HAVE INDICATED TO THE PATIENT THAT I DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR EXPLANATION FOR HER SYMPTOMS. I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THE CASE FURTHER WITH YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER A FORMAL COGNITIVE NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN CASE THIS IS AN UNUSUAL PRESENTATION OF POSTERIOR CORTICAL ATROPHY. THE DISCREPANT FEATURE HERE IS VERY POOR VISUAL ACUITY BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS IS EASY TO MEASURE VISUAL ACUITY GIVEN THE PATIENT'S VISUAL SYMPTOMS. I HAVE NOT MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT IN THE CLINIC UNTIL I HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THE CASE WITH YOU FURTHER.

DIAGNOSIS: PROBABLE POSTERIOR CORTICAL ATROPHY EVOLVING INTO GENERALISED ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. PLAN: REVIEW CRANIAL IMAGING TO DATE - A REPEAT MR MAY BE NECESSARY AS PREVIOUS MRS HAVE CONCENTRATED ON PITUITARY AREAS. DECIDE THEN ON PRESCRIPTION FOR CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR MEDICATION. PATIENT HAS AN APPOINTMENT IN MY NHS CLINIC FOR LATE MAY WHICH I HAVE ASKED THEM TO KEEP. I SAW THIS LADY IN CLINIC TODAY WITH HER HUSBAND. SHE HAS BEEN REFERRED TO MY COGNITIVE DISORDERS CLINIC IN ~ BUT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO WAIT UNTIL MAY AND SO CAME TO SEE ME PRIVATELY. THE HISTORY GOES BACK APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS WITH VISUAL DIFFICULTIES. SHE WAS FOUND TO HAVE BILATERAL CATARACTS FOLLOWING A ROUTINE ASSESSMENT AT THE OPTICIANS AS WELL AS RODENT ULCERS$ WHICH ALL REQUIRED SURGERY BUT UNFORTUNATELY HER VISION DID NOT IMPROVE AFTER THIS.-SHE-WOULD SEE TWO-PEOPLE-COMING UP THE DRIVEWAY OR LOSE HER HUSBAND IN THE SHOP BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM OUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO SHE HAD DIFFICULTY READING THE ORDER OF SERVICE AT THE CHURCH DESPITE WEARING SPECTACLES AND USING A MANUAL WITH LARGE PRINT. SHE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO READ SINCE THEN BUT CAN MAKE OUT INDIVIDUAL LETTERS AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS. AS AN EXAMPLE SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE SMALL NUMBERS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TODAY WHEN CHANGING CHANNEL. GRADUALLY HER VISION HAS DECLINED. SHE IS VERY SLOW TO SEE THINGS THAT ARE POINTED OUT TO HER AND IN FACT NEEDS VERBAL DIRECTION TO LOOK LEFT OR RIGHT BEFORE SHE CAN FIND SOMETHING. ONCE SHE FINDS IT WITH HER EYES SHE CAN GENERALLY SEE IT QUITE CLEARLY. AS AN EXAMPLE SHE HAD DIFFICULTY FOCUSING ON THE TIE I WAS WEARING$TODAY IN CLINIC BUT WHEN SHE SAW IT COULD MAKE OUT THE SMALL PATTERN OF ELEPHANTS$ WHICH HER HUSBAND COULD NOT SEE. SHE IS ALSO ABLE TO POINT OUT SMALL SPECKS ON HER HUSBAND'S SHIRT$ WHICH HE HAD NOT NOTICED HIMSELF. SHE IS CLUMSY WITH HER HANDS AND KNOCKS THINGS OVER WHEN SHE REACHES FOR THEM BUT PARADOXICALLY DOES NOT BUMP INTO FURNITURE. SHE WILL HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY POURING JUICE INTO A CUP AND WILL HAVE TO DO THIS OVER A SINK BECAUSE OF SPILLS. SINCE LAST MONTH SHE HAS CONFUSED AROUSALS AFTER SLEEP$ WHICH WERE PUT DOWN TO LOW LIGHTING AND HAVE IMPROVED WITH BRIGHTER LIGHTS. AS AN EXAMPLE SHE WOKE UP AND WENT TO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROOM AND WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE DOOR AND RECOGNISE WHERE SHE WAS. WHEN WAKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SHE MADE A COMMENT TO HER HUSBAND THAT 'THE ROOMS ARE LARGE HERE'. SHE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE TOILET AND HAD TO BE LED THERE BY HER HUSBAND. SHE HAS DIFFICULTY DISTINGUISHING LEFT FROM RIGHT$ CAN FIND HER WAY AROUND ~ PRETTY WELL BUT ONCE INSIDE A SHOP CANNOT FIND THE EXIT. IN ADDITION THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE DIFFICULTIES. HER HUSBAND DESCRIBES HER AS MUDDLED FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO. HER SHORT TERM MEMORY IS IMPAIRED AND SHE REPEATS QUESTIONS AFTER A FEW MINUTES. SHE CANNOT REMEMBER HOW MANY GRANDCHILDREN SHE HAS OR THEIR DATES OF BIRTH AND THIS IS SOMETHING SHE WOULD RECALL EASILY BEFORE. SHE ALSO HAS PROBLEMS WITH CALCULATION AND HANDLING CASH FOR THE LAST YEAR. OVER THE SAME PERIOD HER WRITING HAS DETERIORATED AND NOW SHE CANNOT WRITE$ HER SIGNATURE. THEY HAD THOUGHT THE MUDDLED THINKING MIGHT BE DUE TO STATINS AND THAT IT HAS IMPROVED SLIGHTLY SINCE THE SIMVASTATIN WAS DISCONTINUED IN EARLY MARCH. SHE HAS HAD ONE EPISODE OF VISUAL HALLUCINATION A YEAR AGO$ THINKING HER HUSBAND HAD A BONFIRE IN THE GARDEN$ BUT NOT SINCE. SHE DOES NOT HAVE A CAPGRAS OR PHANTOM BORDER DELUSION. THERE IS NO OBVIOUS FLUCTUATION AND NO PARKINSONISM. SHE DRESSES PERFECTLY WELL AND CAN DISTINGUISH AND RECOGNISE COLOURS. SHE IS ACTIVE WITH HOUSEHOLD CHORES ALTHOUGH HER HUSBAND HAS TAKEN OVER CERTAIN TASKS$ SUCH AS THE COOKING AS SHE WOULD HAVE PROBLEMS FINDING THE KNOBS ON THE COOKER. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS$ HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND RAISED CHOLESTEROL. CURRENT MEDICATIONS ARE ASPIRIN$ RAMIPRIL$ PREDNISOLONE$ MACRODANTIN AND ALENDRONATE ON A ONCE A WEEK BASIS. THE SIMVASTATIN WAS DISCONTINUED ON THE 3RD MARCH 2008. SHE DOES NOT SMOKE OR DRINK AND WAS A FULL TIME HOUSEWIFE. SHE LEFT SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND WENT INTO HAIRDRESSING. HER SISTER DEVELOPED ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AT THE AGE OF 60. I UNDERSTAND SHE HAS HAD AN MR OF HER BRAIN AND PITUITARY BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILMS BUT READING LETTERS FROM MY COLLEAGUES$ DR ~ AND DR ~ THERE IS A SUGGESTION OF ENLARGEMENT OF THE VENTRICLES$ PERHAPS DUE TO ATROPHY BUT THERE IS NO PARTICULAR COMMENT ABOUT THE POSTERIOR CORTICAL AREAS. SHE HAS HAD VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALS$ WHICH WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS$ I UNDERSTAND AND WOULD BE GOOD EVIDENCE AGAINST A PROCESS INVOLVING THE ANTERIOR VISUAL PATHWAYS. EXAMINATION TODAY SHOWED DIFFICULTY WITH PURSUIT EYE MOVEMENTS ALTHOUGH VOLUNTARY SACCADES WERE GOOD IF A LITTLE HESITANT. SHE HAD BILATERAL OPTIC DISC PALLOR AND APPARENT RIGHT SIDED VISUAL INATTENTION. THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS LATERALISING OR LOCALISING SIGNS AND PLANTARS WERE DOWNGOING. SHE DEMONSTRATED OBVIOUS MISREACHING ON FINGER/NOSE TESTING BUT WAS QUITE ACCURATE WHEN SHE FOUND MY FINGER (OPTIC ATAXIA). SHE HAD EVIDENT LIMB APRAXIA BILATERALLY$ PERHAPS SLIGHTLY BETTER ON THE LEFT SIDE. SHE DEMONSTRATED BODY PART SUBSTITUTIONS AND HAD DIFFICULTY COPYING MEANINGLESS HAND GESTURES. THERE WERE NO PARKINSONIAN FEATURES. HER SPEECH WAS MILDLY APHASIC WITH MARKED ANOMIC PAUSES. COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT WITH THE MMSE GAVE A SCORE OF 14/30. HER ACE-R SCORED 30/100. THESE SCORES WERE IN THE MODERATE TO SEVERELY IMPAIRED RANGE. SUB TEST SCORES ON THE ACE-R WERE ATTENTION AND ORIENTATION 8/18; MEMORY 6/26; FLUENCY 0/14; LANGUAGE 10/26; VISUOSPATIAL 6/16. IN SUMMARY SHE HAS EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL COGNITIVE DEFICITS FOLLOWING ONSET INITIALLY WITH PRIMARILY VISUAL SYMPTOMS. THE VISUAL DISTURBANCE TODAY HAS A HIGHER ORDER FLAVOUR TO IT WITH EVIDENCE OF SIMULTANAGNOSIA$ OPTIC ATAXIA AND A SUGGESTION OF APPERCEPTIVE VISUAL AGNOSIA. IN ADDITION SHE HAS MILD APHASIA AND GLOBAL COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. I WILL NEED TO REVIEW THE RADIOLOGY TO SEE IF THIS GIVES ADEQUATE WHOLE BRAIN VIEWS AND DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF THE SCANS MAY NEED TO BE REPEATED. THE CLINICAL PICTURE WOULD FIT WELL WITH A SYNDROME KNOWN AS POSTERIOR CORTICAL ATROPHY$ WHICH IN MOST CASES IS DUE TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. I EXPLAINED THIS TO HER HUSBAND TODAY WHICH OF COURSE CAME AS SOMETHING OF A SHOCK TO HIM BUT I EXPLAINED THAT SHE MAY FIND USEFUL RESPONSE FROM THE MEMORY ENHANCING CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITING MEDICATION USED FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. I GAVE MRS ~ THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AND EXPLORE THE DIAGNOSIS BUT SHE SEEMED NOT TO WANT TO ASK SPECIFICS. IF I CAN MAKE A DECISION ABOUT CHOLINESTERASE MEDICATION BEFORE I SEE HER IN CLINIC I WILL ARRANGE TO SEND A PRESCRIPTION.

MY BROTHER AND I ARE KEEN FOR HER TO REMAIN IN HER OWN HOME AND ARE ENDEAVOURING TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL HELP AS REQUIRED. SHE HAD A SUCCESSFUL CATARACT OPERATION ON HER LEFT EYE BUT WAS UNABLE TO INSTIL THE EYE DROPS THAT WERE REQUIRED FOR THE TWENTY DAYS FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE. SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE COULD DO THE DROPS AND TOLD ME THAT SHE COULD INSTIL THEM BUT I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE CLEARLY THAT SHE COULD NOT. SHE IS ALSO UNABLE TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS HAD THE OPERATION. IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO REQUEST HELP FROM THE ~ NURSING SERVICE WHO WERE MOST CO-OPERATIVE AND HELPFUL. THE POINT OF THESE NOTES IS TO ADVISE YOU THAT MUM PERCEIVES HER ABILITIES$ DIFFERENTLY FROM THE WAY THEY ACTUALLY ARE. NEVERTHELESS SHE STILL MANAGES HER MEDICATION WELL !

SHE FINDS HER MOTHER STARING WITH HER MOUTH OPEN$ ANSWERING YES TO ALL QUESTIONS AND LOOKING VERY VAGUE. THESE EPISODES LAST INITIALLY DAYS BUT NOW CAN LAST MANY DAYS. HER DAUGHTER FEELS THAT DURING THESE EPISODES$ HER MOTHERS INTAKE IS VERY LIMITED (SHE HAS TO DISCARD LOTS OF FOOD)$ BUT SHE DOES NOTICE HER MOTHER DRINKS LOTS OF LIQUIDS (AT LEAST 4-5 MILKY COFFEES DURING THE DAY TIME). DESPITE THIS$ MRS ~ SEEMS TO BE GAINING WEIGHT. HER DAUGHTER HAS ALSO NOTICED THE MEMORY DECLINE HAS BEEN GRADUAL OVER THE LAST 6 MONTHS. ON EXAMINATION WEIGHT WAS 91.7 KGS (78 KGS IN 2008)$ HEIGHT 152 CROS$ BMI 39 (32 IN 2008). BP 163/71 LYING AND 154/80 STANDING$ PULSE 66 PER MINUTE AND SATS 97% ON ROOM AIR.

ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION REVEALED A VERY PENDULOUS ABDOMEN WITH TENDERNESS$ ESPECIALLY SUPRAPUBICALLY BUT ALSO IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT. THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS SPLENIC ENLARGEMENT OR TENDERNESS$ NO PULSATIONS AND NORMAL BOWEL SOUNDS. THERE WERE NO INGUINAL SWELLINGS OR NODES. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE LIVER WAS CONGESTED AND ENLARGED. ON CNS EXAMINATION SHE HAD EVIDENCE OF BILATERAL CATARACT SURGERY. SHE HAD FULL RANGES OF EYE MOVEMENTS WITH EQUAL AND REACTIVE PUPILS. VISUAL FIELDS REVEALED INCONSISTENT RESPONSES IN THE RIGHT VISUAL FIELD (ESPECIALLY UPPER QUADRANT). THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS ASYMMETRY IN THE FACE AND NO TONGUE FASCICULATIONS. SHE HAD VERY MILD RIGHT UPPER LIMB WEAKNESS BUT NO DRIFT. TOUCH SENSATION WAS INTACT WITH NO SENSORY INATTENTION. POWER WAS SLIGHTLY REDUCED IN THE LEFT HIP (FLEXION) BUT NORMAL BILATERAL FOOT DORSIFLEXION 5/5.

MMSE TODAY WAS 14/30 WITH 0/3 FOR SHORT TERM RECALL AND 2/8 FOR ORIENTATION. HADS REVEALED AN A OF 7 AND D OF 7 (NORMAL SCREENING FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION). CHEST X-RAY FORMAL REPORT IS STILL AWAITED BUT THIS SUGGESTS HYPERINFLATION$ CONSISTENT WITH HER KNOWN SMOKING AND A LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND BLUNTING OF THE RIGHT COSTOPHRENIC ANGLE. THERE WERE NO OTHER HILAR MASSES OR FOCAL CONSOLIDATION. CT HEAD SCAN IS ALSO AWAITING FORMAL REPORT BUT IS SUGGESTIVE OF WIDE-SPREAD PERIVENTRICULAR ISCHAEMIA$ ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT. BLADDER SCAN UNDERTAKEN TODAY DID NOT REVEAL SIGNIFICANT RESIDUAL (64 MIS). IN SUMMARY$ SHE SEEMS TO HAVE VASCULAR COGNITIVE DECLINE$ COR PULMONALE AND A POSSIBLY CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE WITH A LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND COPD. I WILL ARRANGE FOR A SPIROMETRY$ VITAMIN D LEVELS AND I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD INITIATE SPIRONOLACTONE 25 MGS AD AND FUROSEMIDE 40 MGS OD.

TP12192,3922090,90,89090,2,1925,86,1,6792,39,1,16681,489765,CLINICAL LETTER ~~ HOSPITAL MENTAL HEALTH THANK YOU FOR REFERRING MRS ~ TO OUR SERVICES. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HER DETERIORATION IN SELF-CARE$ REDUCED DIET AND FLUID INTAKE AND A GRADUAL REDUCTION OF COGNITION WITH INTERMITTENT PERIODS OF CONFUSION AND ODD BEHAVIOUR OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS. I REVIEWED HER AT HOME IN THE PRESENCE OF DR ~ (OLD AGE CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST) AND HER DAUGHTER ON 25 NOVEMBER 2010. COLLATERAL HISTORY SHE SAID THAT HER MOTHER WENT INTO A DAZE WHICH WOULD INTERMITTENTLY OCCUR$ AND WOULD LAST FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS. THIS FIRST STARTED ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO. I UNDERSTAND SHE WAS WELL IN BETWEEN AND ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN. SHE DESCRIBED THE EPISODES AS STARING AT THE FLOOR OR AT A WALL WITH HER MOUTH OPEN WITH NO EYE CONTACT AT THE TIME. HER DAUGHTER SAID THAT INITIALLY IT USED TO LAST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS$ HOWEVER NOW IT MAY LAST FOR 10-15 DAYS. THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED HER DAUGHTER WONDERED IF HER MOTHER WOULD RECOVER FROM IT AT ALL. THE PREVIOUS EPISODE SHE MENTIONED WAS ABOUT 8 WEEKS AGO. I FOUND THE HISTORY OF ?POSSIBLE ABSENCES QUITE STRANGE AS THEY SEEM TO BE LASTING FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND I WONDER WHAT THIS MAYBE. I UNDERSTAND HER MOTHER HAS NEVER HAD AN AURA FOR THE EPISODES. THERE IS NO HISTORY OF OLFACTORY$ AUDITORY OR VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS.THERE HAVE BEEN NO KNOWN EPISODES OF DT JA VU/ TONI CLONIC SEIZURES EITHER. THERE WAS NO HISTORY SUGGESTIVE OF MYOCLONIC JERKS OR LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS$ ALTHOUGH HER DAUGHTER MENTIONED HER MOTHER GOING INTO A COMA-LIKE STATE. I AM UNSURE OF THE ACCURACY OF THE COLLATERAL HISTORY. HER DAUGHTER WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HER MOTHERS REDUCED DIET FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS. SHE TENDS TO DO HER MOTHERS SHOPPING AND AS THE FOOD IS NOT CONSUMED SHE THROWS IT AWAY. HER MOTHER HAS HOWEVER PUT ON WEIGHT. SHE WAS TOLD BY THE DOCTORS AT THE ~ CLINIC THAT IT COULD BE DUE TO WATER RETENTION. I ALSO UNDERSTAND SHE HAS REFUSED TO HAVE A BATH OR A SHOWER FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS! SHE DOES NOT ALLOW THE CARERS OR HER DAUGHTER TO GIVE HER A BATH. AT THE MOMENT I UNDERSTAND SHE IS STRIP WASHED BY THE CARERS AND HER DAUGHTER WAS NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HER REDUCED PERSONAL CARE. MRS ~ HYGIENE APPEARED VERY POOR AND THERE WAS ALSO AN UNPLEASANT ODOUR FROM THE HOUSE. HER DAUGHTER MENTIONED THAT MRS ~ MEMORY WAS QUITE POOR AND WHEN TESTED BY ONE OF THE DOCTORS 3 WEEKS AGO SHE ONLY KNEW HER BIRTHDAY. SHE HAS BEEN INCONTINENT OF URINE FOR ABOUT 12 WEEKS AND DOUBLY INCONTINENT FOR THE PAST 4 WEEKS. THERE IS NO HISTORY OF SLURRING OF SPEECH. THE DAUGHTER WAS TOLD AT THE ~ UNIT THAT HER MOTHER HAD WEAKNESS OF THE LEFT SIDE OF HER HANDS$ LEGS AND REDUCTION IN VISION. HOWEVER ON DISCUSSING WITH DR ~$ THE GERIATRICIAN$ THERE WERE NO SUCH REPORTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT MRS ~ HAS BEEN LIVING ALONE FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS SINCE HER HUSBAND DIED. SHE USED TO GO TO ~ ON A REGULAR BASIS TILL ABOUT 9 MONTHS AGO. SHE IS NOT KEEN TO GO OUT ANYMORE. SHE HAS BEEN QUITE UNSTEADY ON HER FEET DUE TO A TRAPPED NERVE WHICH I ASSUME IS SCIATICA AND WAS TOLD SHE HAD ARTHRITIS. I UNDERSTAND SHE HAS ALSO HAD A FEW FALLS OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS. HER DAUGHTER FELT THAT HER MOTHER WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY IN CONVERSING OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS$ ALTHOUGH SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIT DYSLEXIC. MRS ~ HAD APPARENTLY TAKEN AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE OF CODEINE ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO. HER DAUGHTER WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER WAS NOT DEPRESSED AND THAT IT WAS INDEED AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE. FOLLOWING THIS OVERDOSE SHE WAS FOUND LYING IN THE BACK GARDEN AND THE PARAMEDICS TOOK HER TO HOSPITAL. FAMILY HISTORY HER SISTER HAS ALZHEIMERS DISEASE. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY THERE IS NO PAST HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS KNOWN. MEDICAL HISTORY ACUTE RENAL FAILURE JULY 2009$ COPD$ CATARACTS WITH RIGHT EXTRACTION AND LEFT EXTRACTION AND IMPLANTS$ HYPERTENSION$ FOOT PAIN$ SCIATICA. I ALSO NOW UNDERSTAND SHE HAS COR PULMONALE AND POSSIBLY A VASCULAR DEMENTIA. CURRENT MEDICATION MOVICOL BD$ SALMETEROL AND FLUTICASONE DRY POWDER INHALER$ VENTOLIN EVOHALER$ CARBAMAZEPINE 100 MG BD FOR LEG PAIN (?NEUROPATHIC)$ ASPIRIN 75 MG OD$ SIMVASTATIN 40 MG NOCTE$ AMOLODIPINE 5 MG OD. DRUG AND ALCOHOL HISTORY I UNDERSTAND SHE USED TO DRINK ABOUT 4-5 GLASSES OF WINE/CANS OF LAGER A WEEK WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS ALIVE. THEY NEVER DRANK IN THE HOUSE. SHE HAS STOPPED DRINKING SINCE HER HUSBANDS DEATH. SHE CONTINUES TO SMOKE ABOUT 20 CIGARETTES PER DAY. SHE USED TO SMOKE ABOUT 30-40 CIGARETTES PER DAY. NO KNOWN HISTORY OF ILLICIT DRUG USE. SOCIAL HISTORY SHE DOES NOT DO ANY COOKING$ CLEANING OR ANY HOUSEHOLD CHORES. SHE TENDS TO SIT ON THE CHAIR ALL DAY LONG. HER DAUGHTER VISITS EVERY ALTERNATE DAY. THE CARERS COME IN TWICE A DAY AND PROMPT HER FOR MEDICATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN A DOSETTE BOX. THE CARERS HELP HER TO STRIP WASH AND SHE TENDS TO DRESS ON HER OWN. SHE ALSO HAS A CAT IN THE HOUSE. SHE DOES NOT GET OUT OF THE HOUSE (FOR 6 MONTHS). SHE DOES NOT GO TO A DAY CENTRE AND HER DAUGHTER WAS NOT KEEN FOR THIS$ DUE TO MOBILITY ISSUES. SHE HAS HAD FALLS ABOUT EVERY 6 WEEKS OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS. MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION SHE WAS AN ELDERLY$ OVERWEIGHT LADY WITH REDUCED PERSONAL CARE. THERE WAS A STRONG UNPLEASANT ODOUR FROM THE ROOM AND HER CLOTHES. SHE APPEARED FLAT$ AND APATHETIC. SHE MADE MINIMAL CONVERSATION$ WITH REDUCED SPONTANEITY. THERE WERE ONLY MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS. SHE HAD EXPRESSIVE DYSPHASIA$ DYSARTHRIA AND RECEPTIVE DYSPHASIA. SHE CALLED A PEN PENNY. ON TESTING HER COGNITION SHE SCORED 8/25$ SCORING 2/10 ON ORIENTATION AND 2/3 ON REGISTRATION AND 0/3 ON RECALL. SHE WAS NOT KEEN TO DO THE WRITTEN TASKS. POOR INSIGHT. ON HAVING A LOOK AT YOUR REFERRAL LETTER AND THE MEDICAL HISTORY I WAS UNABLE TO SEE ANY PAST HISTORY OF PETIT MAL EPILEPSY. I UNDERSTAND THAT HER GRANDSON HAD EPILEPTIC SEIZURES AND SO DID HER NEICE. HER SISTER HAS ALZHEIMERS DISEASE. I HENCE CALLED DR ~$ GP$ TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANY FURTHER INFORMATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GP SURGERY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CT SCAN RESULTS AND WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY HISTORY OF SEIZURES IN THE PAST. SHE HAS BEEN ON CARBAMAZEPINE DUE TO NEUROPATHIC PAIN. FOLLOWING MY CONVERSATION WITH DR ~ I CALLED DR ~$ THE GERIATRICIAN AT ~~. HE GAVE A HISTORY OF REDUCED SELF-CARE$ DOUBLE INCONTINENCE ON A BACKGROUND OF COR PULMONALE$ VASCULAR DEMENTIA AND RECENT TREATMENT FOR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. AT HIS ASSESSMENT HE SAID THAT MRS ~ GAVE VERY LITTLE HISTORY$ HAD VERY POOR INSIGHT AND THOUGHT SHE WAS GRAND. HE MENTIONED THAT HER DAUGHTER WHO SEEMED TO BE A POOR HISTORIAN GAVE A HISTORY OF NUMEROUS EPISODES OF ABSENCES WHICH SEEMED TO BE LASTING FOR DAYS WHICH UNDERSTANDABLY DR ~ FOUND QUITE BIZARRE AS WELL. HE MENTIONED THAT HER MMSE WAS 14/30. THE HAD SHOWED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION 7. A CT SCAN DONE HAS NOT YET BEEN REPORTED$ HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS PERIVENTRICULAR ISCHAEMIA. THERE WAS NO RESIDUAL ON THE BLADDER SCAN. THE ECG SHOWED BILATERAL BORDERLINE FIRST DEGREE AV BLOCK. CHEST X- RAY SHOWED HYPERINFLATION AND LEFT-SIDED PLEURAL EFFUSION. HIS IMPRESSION WAS THAT MRS ~ HAD A VASCULAR COGNITIVE DECLINE ON A BACKGROUND OF COR PULMONALE. THE PLAN WAS TO CHECK VITAMIN B12 LEVEL$ TO REQUEST THE GP TO GIVE MORE DIURETICS AND TO HAVE AN MDT MEETING FOR THE REPORT. HIS OPINION WAS VERY HELPFUL. IMPRESSION MRS ~ SEEMS TO BE A LADY WITH COGNITIVE DECLINE WITH SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADLS) OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS. THESE EPISODES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SUDDEN IN ONSET ASSOCIATED WITH EPISODES OF STRANGE ABSENCE-LIKE EPISODES. THESE DAZED SPELLS HOWEVER DO NOT SEEM TO CORRELATE WITH A TYPICAL ABSENCE SEIZURE. I AM UNSURE WHAT THE CAUSE OF THESE MIGHT BE. SHE POSSIBLY HAS A VASCULAR DEMENTIA WHICH IS DECLINING. UNFORTUNATELY AS SHE HAS A BORDERLINE FIRST DEGREE AV BLOCK$ AS YOU ARE AWARE$ IT IS A CONTRAINDICATION FOR STARTING CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS AND HENCE WE ARE UNABLE TO PRESCRIBE HER ANYTHING. AT THE MOMENT THERE IS NO ASSOCIATED DEPRESSION OR BEHAVIOURAL SYMPTOMS WHICH WOULD NEED TREATMENT. HER DAUGHTER WOULD BE HAPPY FOR THE CARE PACKAGE TO BE INCREASED BY THE TEAM AND SHE ALSO WONDERED IF A CHIROPODIST COULD SEE HER MOTHER. I WONDER$ IF IT WOULD PERHAPS BE BEST TO CONSIDER RESIDENTIAL HOME FOR THIS LADY$ IN THE FUTURE; IN VIEW OF HER SELF CARE NEEDS NOT BEING MET IN THE CURRENT HOME SITUATION. PLAN 1 1 AM UNSURE OF THE CAUSE OF THESE ATYPICAL ABSENCE-LIKE EPISODES AND WONDERED IF AN EEG MAY HELP. I AM HENCE REQUESTING THE SAME. 2 SHE RECEIVES A CARE PACKAGE OF TWICE A DAY HER DAUGHTER WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF HER TEAM SOCIAL WORKER COULD KINDLY INCREASE THIS. 3 SHE HAS HAD AN OT ASSESSMENT AND THE DAUGHTER DECLINED FURTHER SUPPORT WITH REGARDS TO THAT. 4 I HAD OFFERED A DAY CENTRE REFERRAL BUT HER DAUGHTER DID NOT FEEL HER MOTHER WOULD ENJOY THAT. 5 IF POSSIBLE HER DAUGHTER WOULD BE KEEN FOR A CHIROPODY REFERRAL FOR HER NAILS. 6 I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD KINDLY FAX THE CT SCAN RESULTS TO US. 7 I SHALL AWAIT THE EEG RESULTS AND SEND THEM TO YOU WITH A VIEW TO REVIEWING HER WITH THE RESULTS.

HISTORY FROM THE WIFE IS THAT 2 YEARS SHE NOTICED THAT HIS SHORT TERM MEMORY WAS STARTING TO DECLINE AND HE WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY FORGETFUL. THIS HAS GOT EXPEDIENTLY WORSE IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS TO THE POINT SHE HAS HAD TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER ORDER ADLS SUCH AS FINANCES. SHE DESCRIBED HOW HE WAS ALWAYS METICULOUS WRITING AND KEEPING NOTE OF EXPENSESBUT THIS HAD ALL CEASED AND HE WAS LOSING WHERE HAD PUT DOCUMENTS. HE IS STILL CAPABLE OF HELPING WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND BASIC ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING SUCH AS GETTING UP AND WASHING AND DRESSING. OF NOTE IS THAT HE CONTINUES TO DRIVE AND HAS DRIVEN ALL HIS LIFE BECAUSE OF BEING A SALES REPRESENTATIVE. HIS WIFE FEELS THAT THE MECHANICS OF DRIVING REMAIN THE SAME. HE IS NOT GETTING LOST BUT SHE DOES FEEL THAT HE DOESNT SEE THINGS AS QUICKLY AS SHE DOES AND THAT HIS REACTION TIME IS SLIGHTLY DOWN. HIS APPETITE AND SLEEP REMAIN GOOD AND THERES BEEN MINOR CHANGE IN PERSONALITY IN THAT HE SOCIALISES AND TALKS SLIGHTLY LESS. TENDS TO LOSE TRACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY I GATHER HE HAS HAD A RAISED CHOLESTEROL IN THE PAST BUT IS NOW NO LONGER ON A STATIN.

AS YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH HIS MEMORY AND AN MRI SCAN RESULT SHOWED HYPERINTENSITIES IN THE DEEP WHITE MATTER AND IN THE PERIVENTRICULAR AREAS. THE HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION WAS ENTIRELY NORMAL WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE A DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMERS. THEREFORE IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSIS HE WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE VASCULAR DEMENTIA SECONDARY TO SMALL VESSEL DISEASE. I HAVE DISCUSSED THE DIAGNOSIS WITH MR ~ AND HIS WIFE AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIFESTYLE CHANGES$ DIET$ AND EXERCISE AND ALSO TO GET HIS CHOLESTEROL CHECKED AS THATS THE ONLY VASCULAR RISK FACTOR I THINK I COULD FIND. I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH HIM REGARDING ATTENDANCE ALLOWANCE AND THE EMERGENCY FAMILY CARERS PLAN. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF HIS GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER NAMELY HIS CROHNS I DO NOT THINK HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE USUAL MEDICATIONS FOR SMALL VESSEL DISEASE SUCH AS ASPIRIN OR CLOPIDOGREL. I WILL BE DISCHARGING HIM FROM THE CLINIC BUT HE WILL HAVE A POST DIAGNOSTIC FOLLOW UP BY ONE OF OUR SPECIALIST NURSES IN APPROXIMATELY 2 MONTHS TIME.

I VISITED MR ~ ON THE 9TH FEBRUARY 2009. MR ~ WAS STILL IN HIS DRESSING GOWN WHEN I VISITED$ BUT I IE DIDN'T RECOGNISE ME OR REMEMBER ME VISITING TO ASSESS HIM IN THE PAST. HE WAS ABLE TO TELL ME HE WAS ON A REDUCING REGIME OF HIS EYE DROPS$ BUT ON CLOSER QUESTIONING SEEMED VAGU ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS. HOWEVER HE REFERRED TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SHEET. H DESCRIBED HIS MEMORY AS BEING OK$ AND STATED HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FORGETFUL. IT WAS STRANGE TO NOTE HE INITIALLY TOLD ME HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY MEDICATION$ AND WAS PHYSICALLY FIT OTHER THAN HIS KNEE FROM A SPORTING INJURY. WHEN ASKING HIM LATER HE TOLD ME HE WAS ON MEDICATION$ BUT WASN'T SURE WHAT IT WAS FOR. HE LATER DISCLOSED HE HAD TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FINGERS$ WITH SOME LOSS OF FEELING. HE REPORTS HE IS EATING AND SLEEPING WELL$ AND HAS NO WORRIES. I CARRIED OUT AN ACE TEST AND HE WAS FULLY ORIENTATED TO TIME$ DATE$ PLACE$ SCORED WELL WITH ATTENTION / CONCENTRATION 5/5$ BUT SCORED 0/3 ON SHORT TERM RECALL. HE WAS UNABLE TO NAME THE PRIME MINISTER BUT KNEW HE WAS ~$ BUT COULD RECALL ~~. HE WAS ALSO UNABLE TO NAME THE PAST$ AND PRESENT PRESIDENT OF THE USA. THERE WAS A SLIGHT DETERIORATION IN HIS VERBAL FLUENCY FROM HIS LAST TEST IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR. HE LOST POINTS FOR LANGUAGE$ AND WAS UNABLE TO RECALL ONE OF THE PICTURES. HE ALSO DETERIORATED IN HIS OVERALL MEMORY AS HE WAS UNABLE TO REMEMBER ANY OF THE ADDRESS AT THE START OF THE TEST$ EVEN WITH PROMPTING OF THE POSSIBLE ANSWERS. HIS OVERALL SCORES WERE 24/30 MMSE WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS LAST YEAR$ BUT HE HAD DETERIORATED FROM 73 TO 66 ON THE ACE. APPARENTLY HE STILL DRIVES TO THE ~ AND ~ CLUB$ AND HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF A:; ENJOYING THE OUTDOORS WITH ATTENDING HOUND TRAILS ETC. HE DID SOUND REPETITIVE IN SPEECH AT TIMES$ ASKING THE SAME QUESTION. IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE HE WAS UNABLE TO TELL ME HIS SON'S PHONE NUMBER IN ~ OR EVEN FIND IT IN HIS TELEPHONE DIRECTORY. I WASN'T CONVINCED HE IS TAKING HIS MEDICATION REGULARLY$ AS THERE WAS ONLY ONE TABLET TAKEN FROM THE CURRENT BOXES$ ISSUED ON THE 4T' OF FEBRUARY. HOWEVER HE HAD 16 ASPIRIN'S LEFT FROM THE ONES ISSUED ON THE 7TH$ JAN$ AND 18 ATTENOLOL FROM THE SAME DATE$ AND ACTUALLY HAD A FULL BOX OF ATTENOLOL. ~ ALSO HAD A BOX OF BENDROFLUAZIDE 2.5 MG FROM 21'AT OCTOBER LAST YEAR. I WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN HIS SON'S DETAILS TO GET HIS POINT OF VIEW. ~ COMMENTED ON HAVING A SISTER IN ~$ ~ WITH MEMORY PROBLEMS AND SO THERE MAY BE A FAMILY HISTORY I NEED TO EXPLORE THE IDEA OF INTRODUCING A BLISTER PACK$ AS HE WAS UNCOMMITTED AT THE TIME$ SO I WILL VISIT AGAIN WHEN I RETURN FROM ANNUAL LEAVE.

A REVIEW WAS CARRIED OUT IN FEBRUARY AND A LETTER SENT ACCORDINGLY. DR ~ ALSO TRIED TO VISIT IN APRIL FOLLOWING HIM SENDING A LETTER$ BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE WHEN HE CALLED. DR ~ ALSO CALLED ON THE 30'' JUNE$ BUT AGAIN WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN GAINING ENTRY AS NO ONE WAS IN. I VISITED MR ~ ON THE 15TH JULY$ UNEXPECTED. HE DIDN'T APPEAR TO RECOGNISE ME$ AND HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF A PHONE CALL FROM OUR SECRETARY IN LATE JUNE TELLING HIM THE CONSULTANT WAS GOING TO VISIT. ON ENTERING THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF BLOOD AS HE HAD SUSTAINED A SKIN FLAP TO HIS HAND$ BUT SEEMED UNSURE AS TO HOW IT HAPPENED STATING HE MUST HAVE KNOCKED IT ON SOMETHING. ON ASKING HIM ABOUT ORIENTATION TO MONTH$ HE STATED IT WAS FEBRUARY. I HAVE AGAIN RAISED CONCERNS OVER HIS DRIVING$ AND IN PARTICULAR WITH DRINKING$ BUT HE REFUSES TO SHARE MY CONCERNS. HE INSISTS HE IS SAFE$ AND IT IS HIS ONLY MEANS OF GETTING AROUND$ AND WITHOUT IT 'I MAY AS WELL BE IN A HOME'. HE AGAIN HAS MULTIPLE BOXES OF MEDICATION IN THE HOUSE$ WITH NONE APPEARING FULLY EMPTY$ SO I SUSPECT HE IS NOT TAKING THESE AS OFTEN AS HE SHOULD. HE IS NOW AGREEING TO TRY A BLISTER PACK$ AS HE IS AWARE THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDICATION BOXES NOW ACCUMULATING$ WHICH ISN'T SAFE WITH THE GRAND CHILDREN BEING AROUND. ON CHECKING THE VEHICLE THERE WERE SOME MORE RECENT MINOR SCRATCHES TO THE PASSENGER SIDE$ ONE OF THE STAFF WHO LIVES LOCALLY REPORTS HE GOES OUT IN IT A LOT$ AND OFTEN LEAVES THE WINDOWS OPEN AT NIGHT. I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH DR ~ THAT GIVEN THE RISKS$ THE GP PRACTICE COULD INFORM THE DVLA TO HAVE HIM ASSESSED. I WILL REQUEST ANOTHER CONSULTANT VISIT$ BUT AGAIN THE CHANCES OF CATCHING HIM IN ARE DIFFICULT. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO HIS SON ON THE PHONE WHO REPORTS HE IS GETTING WORSE$ HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT HIM DRIVING$ BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO TELL HIM TO STOP DRIVING$ AS IT IS HIS LIFE LINE. I ASKED IF HIS SON COULD LOOK INTO A BLISTER PACK TWO WEEKS AGO$ BUT NOTE THIS HAS STILL NOT BEEN PUT IN PLACE.

IT HAS BEEN QUITE SOME TIME SINCE I LAST SAW MR ~. IN FACT ABOUT A YEAR AS HE HAS ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS NOT BEEN IN WHEN I HAVE CALLED TO SEE HIM AGAIN IN THE INTERIM. THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS FROM MR ~ FAMILY ABOUT A DETERIORATION IN HIS MEMORY AND HE IS PARTICULARLY BAD AT THIS ELEMENT OF COGNITIVE TESTING$ ALTHOUGH HIS ORIENTATION IS REASONABLE AND THERE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT PERCEPTUAL OR VISUO-SPATIAL PROBLEMS. HE HAS ONLY DROPPED TWO POINTS ON MMSE TO 23/30 SINCE I LAST SAW HIM BUT I THINK THIS HIDES THE FACT THAT HIS IMMEDIATE RECALL IS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE. I DO FEEL THAT THE HISTORY IS FITTING WITH A VASCULAR DEMENTIA (ICD10 F01). OF CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT MR ~ IS STILL DRIVING HIS CAR. HIS SON TOLD ME THAT HE RARELY GETS IT OUT OF SECOND GEAR AND TENDS TO DRIVE AROUND A BIT TOO SLOWLY. IN FACT HE HAS HAD A COUPLE OF MINOR COLLISIONS ACCORDING TO HIS SON AND HE WILL ALSO DRIVE TO THE PUB$ DRINK A PINT OF BEER AND THEN COME HOME IN IT WHICH GIVEN HIS COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IS RATHER WORRYING. I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH MR ~ SON THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING BUT UNFORTUNATELY MR ~ HIMSELF IS QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THIS AND FEELS THERE IS NO PROBLEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT DVLA HAVE BEEN INFORMED BUT I WILL DROP THEM ANOTHER LINE ASKING IF THEY CAN EXPEDITE THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION. MR ~ SON TOLD ME THAT HIS FATHER WAS LOOKING AT MOVING INTO ~~ RESIDENTIAL HOME. MR ~ HIMSELF DOES SEEM REASONABLY KEEN ON THE IDEA FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL COMPANY ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT HIS SON HAS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH TALKING HIM AROUND TO THE IDEA. NONETHELESS MR ~ DID SEEM AGREEABLE TO THE MOVE WHICH THEY ARE HOPING WILL OCCUR BEFORE WINTER SETS IN.

HER HAEMOGLOBIN IS JUST AT OR ABOVE THE UPPER LIMIT OF NORMAL. THE REMAINDER OF THE RED CELL INDICES IS UNREMARKABLE SO THE PCV IS JUST ACCEPTABLE AT 0.52. THE PATTERN OF RESULTS SUGGESTS A PSEUDO-POLYCYTHAEMIA WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRES NO ACTIVE INTERVENTION. I NOTE THAT SHE HAS A CARDIAC PROBLEM AND THIS MAY BE CONTRIBUTORY. I ASSUME SHE IS ALSO ON MEDICATION FOR HYPERTENSION WHICH SIMILARLY CAN INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OF HAEMOGLOBIN AND HAEMATOCRIT. REASSURINGLY SHE IS A NON-SMOKER AND IS NOT ON DIURETICS. AT THIS STAGE OTHER THAN ADVISING HER ON OPTIMUM HYDRATION I WOULD SUGGEST NO OTHER ACTIVE INTERVENTION IS PRESENTLY NECESSARY. A REPEAT OF HER BLOOD COUNT IN 4-6 MONTHS WOULD BE SENSIBLE.

TP12941,4790541,541,107541,2,1928,78,1,5085,28,3,31,216853,DR ~~ OLDER PERSONS MENTAL HEALTH ~~ HOSPITAL 28/04/06 THANK YOU FOR REFERRING MRS ~ WHO I SAW ON ~~ BEHALF AT HOME WITH HER HUSBAND ON 27/04/2006. HER HUSBAND DESCRIBED HOW SHE HAD AN ANGIOGRAN$ AND AT THE SAME TIME HER MEDICATION CHANGE RESULTED IN WHAT I PRESUME TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DRUG ALLERGY WHEN HER WHOLE BODY SKIN TURNED RED. THERE WERE NO OTHER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS AT THAT TIME. WHEN SHE HAD THE STENT PUT IN HOWEVER SHE WAS CLEARLY CONFUSED AND WANDERING IN THE WARD. THE STAFF ON THE WARD CALLED HER HUSBAND AT LAM AND AT 5AM AND WHEN HE CAME IN SHE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISE HIM. HER HUSBAND SPOKE TO THE CARDIOLOGIST DR ~ AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT POSSIBLY TO BE A STROKE RESULTING FROM THE PROCEDURE$ THE CT SCAN WAS NORMAL. THE HUSBAND WAS TOLD) HER MENTAL STATE MIGHT BE A REACTION TO THE DYE USED IN THE PROCEDURE. THE HUSBAND COULD NOT IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH MEMORY OR OTHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE. HE DID SAY HE FELT THAT SHE HAD POSSIBLY DETERIORATED A LITTLE DURING THE PAST 6 MONTHS ALTHOUGH SOME DAYS WERE BETTER THAN OTHERS. SHE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN DOING THINGS FOR HERSELF; EVEN TO THE EXTENT SHE IS AFRAID SHE CANNOT CROSS THE ROAD UNAIDED. HER HUSBAND HAS TAKEN OVER THE COOKING AND MOST THE CLEANING IN THE LAST 8 YEARS SINCE THEY BOTH RETIRED AND SHE DOES LESS AND LESS IN THE HOME$ SHE CLEARLY DEPENDS ON HIM A GREAT DEAL. HE DESCRIBED SAME SPATIAL DISORIENTATION IN THE HOUSE WHERE SHE COULD LOSE HER WAY. SHE IS UNDERSTANDABLY WORRIED THAT SHE CANNOT COPE WITHOUT HER HUSBAND'S SUPPORT$ INDEED THE MORNING WHEN I VISITED HER HUSBAND HAD HAD AN APPOINTMENT IN ~ FOR HIS KNEE AND SHE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS ABOUT BEING IN THE HOUSE BY HERSELF. SHE ALSO HAS DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING PEOPLE'S NAMES SUCH AS THE GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN AND GETS FRUSTRATED AND DISTRESSED AND OCCASIONALLY UPSET BY THIS. SHE IS NEVER PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED HOWEVER AND STILL MANAGES TO ENJOY LIFE$ PARTICULARLY CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY AND HER HUSBAND'S COMPANY AND ALSO WATCHING THE TELEVISION. IN ADDITION TO HER MEDICATION FOR PHYSICAL CONDITIONS$ SHE HAS BEEN TAKING TEMAZEPAM FOR ABOUT A YEAR. UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WAS TAKING 10MG WHEN SHE WENT TO BED AND A FURTHER 10MG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IF SHE AWOKE. HER HUSBAND HAS CUT HER DOWN TO TAKING ONLY AN ADDITIONAL 5MG OCCASIONALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE 10MG WHICH SHE TAKES WHEN SHE GOES TO BED. HE WONDERED WHETHER TEMAZEPAM MIGHT BE CONTRIBUTING TO HER CONFUSION. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO TRY AND GRADUALLY REDUCE THE TEMAZEPAM$ IF THIS IS POSSIBLE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME$ AND EVEN DISCONTINUE IT IF THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED. AS YOU MENTIONED SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ANXIOUS PERSON$ AS WAS HER FATHER$ ALTHOUGH THIS NEVER LIMITED HER SUBSTANTIALLY EARLIER IN LIFE. SHE WORKED IN A LOCAL SHOPLFOR 31 YEARS AND AFTER RETIREMENT SHE AND HER HUSBAND HELPED TO LOOK AFTER GREAT GRANDCHILDREN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF CHECKING THINGS VERY THOROUGHLY AND EVEN NOW CHECKS ALL THE DOORS AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE SHE GOES TO BED AND OCCASIONALLY WILL GET UP AND CHECK THEM AGAIN. I DID NOT GET THE IMPRESSION HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS A VERY INTRUSIVE FACTOR IN HER LIFE. THEY BOTH SAID THAT THE LAST 2 YEARS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WITH A SUCCESSION OF ILLNESSES IN THE HUSBAND$ FAMILY EVENTS AND HER HEALTH PROBLEMS. AS YOU WILL:*OBABLY BE AWARE THE HUSBAND HAD A HEART ATTACK$ A NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL KNEE REPLACEMENT$ A FALL WHERE HE CUT HIS HAND AND HAD TO HAVE STITCHES$ A GASTRIC BLEED SECONDARY TO ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS IN ADDITION TO ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE HAS HAD. THEY HAVE A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY WITH 2 DAUGHTERS WHO LIVE LOCALLY$ 4 GRANDCHILDREN $AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. ONE OF GRANDCHILDREN HAS RECENTLY EMIGRATED TO ~$ HAVING PREVIOUSLY WON A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON THE LOTTERY. THEY ALSO HAVE SUPPORT FROM MR ~ SISTER WHO WAS WIDOWED AND LIVES LOCALLY. THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 57 YEARS. MRS ~ DOES NOT SMOKE OR DRINK ALCOHOL. AT INTERVIEW SHE WAS SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS AND SOMEWHAT HESITANT BUT SMART$ PLEASANT$ CO OPERATIVE AND ABLE TO RELATE WELL AT A SOCIAL LEVEL. SHE WAS CHEERFUL AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MILD DYSPHASIA IT DID NOT INTERFERE SUBSTANTIALLY WITH COMMUNICATION. ON COGNITIVE TESTING SHE SCORED 16/30 ON MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION AND ON OTHER TESTING SHE HAD SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES WITH FRONTAL LOBE (EXECUTIVE FUNCTION). SHE HAS: SIGNIFICANT DYSPRAXIA AND A MILD DEGREE OF NOMINAL DYSPHASIA. AS FAR AS DIAGNOSIS IS CONCERNED I THINK THIS IS MOST LIKELY TO REPRESENT A GENERALISED VASCULAR DEMENTIA ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE THERE IS A ALSO A COMPONENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. ALTHOUGH I WILL LOOK INTO WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DYE USED IN THE PROCEDURE MIGHT HAVE HAD AN EFFECT$ I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS. I WILL LOOK AT THE GENERAL NOTES TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I CAN GAIN FURTHER FROM THIS$ AND INDEED HAVE A FURTHER LOOK AT THE CT BRAIN SCAN. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE LOOKING FOR OBVIOUS STROKE DISEASE$ IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT SMALL VESSEL DISEASE OF A MORE DIFFUSE NATURE WHICH ACCOUNT FOR HER SYMPTOMS. I HAVE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT I DID NOT THINK THAT THERE WAS ANY NEED FOR ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL$ WHICH GREATLY RELIEVED HER. SHE WAS CLEARLY QUITE ANXIOUS BUT MY EXPLANATION OF HER SYMPTOMS WAS THAT IT WAS LIKELY THAT AT SOME TIME DURING OR AROUND THE STENT BEING PUT IN THERE HAD BEEN PRE-EXISTING POOR CIRCULATION IN THE BRAIN BUT THIS WAS REVEALED RATHER THAN CAUSED BY THE PROCEDURE$ DESCRIBING IT AS 'THE STRAW WHICH BREAKS THE CAMELS BACK'. NEITHER MRS ~ NOR HER HUSBAND WANTED ANY FURTHER INTERVENTION AT THE PRESENT TIME AND I DO NOT THINK ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION WOULD HELP IN HER FUTURE MANAGEMENT. IF HE HAD BEEN ASKING FOR SOME ONGOING SUPPORT THEN IT WOULD BE REASONABLE' TO THINK OF THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH NURSE BEING INVOLVED$ BUT I THINK THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS WOULD DESTABILISE THE SITUATION RATHER THAN SUPPORT IT. I WOULD THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT YOU KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE SITUATION YOURSELF AS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING AND MAKE AN EARLY REFERRAL BACK TO THE SERVICE SHOULD THERE BE A SITUATION WHERE MORE SUPPORT IS NEEDED. IN PARTICULAR I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD MANAGE WITHOUT HER HUSBAND'S SUPPORT ALTHOUGH I WOULD ANTICIPATE THERE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL OF FAMILY SUPPORT AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN IF THERE IS ANYTHING FURTHER I CAN ADD ONCE I HAVE HAD A MORE CAREFUL LOOK AT HER ~ GENERAL HOSPITAL NOTES. PS I HAVE NOW OBTAINED THE ~ GENERAL HOSPITAL CARDIAC NOTES.'$ WHILST THE CT SCAN EXCLUDES A MAJOR STROKE IT WOULD NOT EXCLUDE GENERALISED CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASE OR ALZHEIMERS DISEASE. IT SEEMS THAT SHE HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO THE DYE ON BOTH OCCASIONS$ CAUSING A MARKED ERYTHEMA FOR WHICH SHE WAS TREATED WITH HYDROCORTISONE AND ANTIHISTAMINE. THERE IS NO MENTION HOWEVER OF ANY LIKELIHOOD OR SUGGESTION THAT THE DYE MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. THE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT SHE HAD MILD UNDERLYING COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND THE STRESS OF BEING IN HOSPITAL$ THE PROCEDURE AND BEING UNWELL WITH AN ALLERGIC REACTION PRECIPITATED THE DETERIORATION$ RATHER THAN CAUSING COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. I THINK GIVEN THIS FURTHER INFORMATION IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT FURTHER GRADUAL DETERIORATION EITHER AS A RESULT OF EXISTING CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASE OR THE POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL ALZHEIMERS DISEASE.,9N36.00,Letter from specialist,38835,38846,TP

MR ~ IS KNOWN TO ME. MR ~ IS FRUSTRATED AS HE DOES NOT WANT TO STAY IN ~ NURSING HOME AND WANTS TO RETURN TO HIS OWN HOME. HE GETS AGGRESSIVE AT TIMES AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY. HE HAS NO PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS AND STATED QUITE CATEGORICALLY THAT HE IS STAYING THERE AGAINST HIS WISHES. THEREFORE$ I SPOKE TO HIS DAUGHTER (~) AND INFORMED HER THAT HER FATHER IS VERY FRUSTRATED AND WANTS TO RETURN TO HIS OWN HOME. HOWEVER$ IF HE DOES SETTLE DOWN IN THE NURSING HOME THEN THIS WILL BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO HIS FUTURE CARE AS HE WILL NEED MAXIMUM SUPPORT FROM SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE FAMILY IF HE RETURNS HOME. OF COURSE$ HIS FAMILY WILL BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE FULL-TIME HELP IN VIEW OF THEIR OWN FAMILY COMMITMENTS.

I OBTAINED SOME COLLATERAL HISTORY FROM THE NURSE IN CHARGE OF ~. I UNDERSTAND THAT MR ~ HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN LIVING ALONE WITH CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FROM HIS SEVEN CHILDREN. AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER HE DEVELOPED A CHEST INFECTION WHEN HE WENT 'OFF HIS LEGS'. HE WAS SEEN BY ONE OF HIS GPS AND ADMITTED TO A NURSING HOME FOR RESPITE. HE WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON THE 27 NOVEMBER BY WHICH TIME HE WAS BACK ON HIS FEET. HIS FAMILY WERE UNABLE TO COPE AND HE WAS READMITTED FOR RESPITE BY THE RATS TEAM TO ~ ON THE 1 DECEMBER. AT THIS POINT HIS FAMILY STATED THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND WANTED HIM TO REMAIN IN PERMANENT CARE. I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS HAD SOME COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DEVELOPING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS$ ALTHOUGH DETAILS OF THIS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ME. SINCE BEING IN ~~ HE HAS REQUIRED ASSISTANCE WITH HIS SELF-CARE BUT IS FREQUENTLY RESISTIVE. HE BECOMES UNSETTLED FROM LUNCH TIME ONWARDS WHEN HE BEGINS TO ASK TO GO HOME AND TRIES TO GET OUT OF ~ WHICH REQUIRES STAFF REPEATEDLY TO BRING HIM BACK. HE IS PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE AT TIMES AND SHOUTS OUT. MR ~ HAS BEEN UNABLE TO RETAIN INFORMATION FOR MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS. HE IS NOW MOBILE AND I UNDERSTAND HAS RECENTLY BEEN SEEN BY DR ~ WHO FOUND NO PHYSICAL CAUSE FOR HIS SYMPTOMS. MR ~ IS DISTURBED AT NIGHT WHEN HE WILL GET UP AND WANDER AROUND ~. HIS APPETITE IS REASONABLE IF HE CAN BE SETTLED THROUGH MEAL TIMES. WHEN MR ~ FAMILY VISIT HE IS VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE WITH THEM. MR ~HAD BEEN SEEN BY DR ~ ON THE DAY PRIOR TO MY VISIT AND GIVEN DIAZEPAM 5 MG STAT WHICH HAD SETTLED HIM DOWN. I HAVE NO INFORMATION REGARDING MR ~ MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY OR HIS PERSONAL HISTORY. HIS MEDICATION AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT WAS TRAMADOL PRN. ON MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT MR ~ WAS AN INDEPENDENTLY MOBILE$ UNSHAVEN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. HE WAS CO-OPERATIVE WITH MY INTERVIEW AND DURING MY VISIT THERE WAS NO OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF PSYCHOMOTOR AGITATION OR RETARDATION. THERE WAS SOME HEARING IMPAIRMENT EVIDENT BUT COMMUNICATION WAS NO PROBLEM. MR ~ SPEECH WAS SPONTANEOUS AND OF NORMAL FORM. THERE WAS NO OVERT DYSPHASIA BUT SOME REPETITIVENESS. HIS MOOD WAS EUTHYMIC AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT. I ELICITED NO DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS. ON COGNITIVE TESTING MR ~  WAS DISORIENTATED TO TIME AND PLACE AND ALTHOUGH ABLE TO REGISTER INFORMATION HAD NO RECALL AFTER A FEW MOMENTS. HE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF RECENT EVENTS AND COULD NOT REMEMBER ANY PROBLEMS. MR ~ COULD NOT REMEMBER HIS HOME ADDRESS AND WAS UNSURE HOW LONG HE HAD LIVED AT ~. HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME HIS CORRECT AGE AND DATE OF BIRTH. HE HAD NO INSIGHT INTO HIS CONDITION OR SITUATION. AT THE TIME OF MY VISIT MR ~ TOLD ME THAT HE WAS WELL LOOKED AFTER WHERE HE WAS AND WAS HAPPY TO STAY THERE. IN SUMMARY MR ~  IS A 91 YEAR OLD WIDOWER WITH DEMENTIA ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN THE MODERATE TO SEVERE RANGE BEHAVIOURAL DISTURBANCE. I HAVE COMMENCED HIM ON RISPERIDONE 0.5 MG ONCE DAILY AND WILL ASK DR ~ STAFF GRADE TO REVIEW HIM IN THE WEEK BEGINNING THE 31 DECEMBER. I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT MR ~ MAY REQUIRE PERMANENT CARE IN AN EMI HOME.,E00..12,Senile/presenile dementia,37253,37259,TP

AS YOU KNOW$ ~ IS HAVING SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH HER MEMORY$ BUT IS RELUCTANT TO DISCUSS THESE. SHE DOES NOT ALWAYS REMEMBER THE DAY AND THE DATE$ AND HER SON HAS TENDED TO RING AND REMIND HIS MOTHER ABOUT APPOINTMENTS. HER SON LIVES ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY$ BUT USUALLY SEES HER ONCE A WEEK TO DO HER HEAVY SHOPPING. SHE LIVES IN WARDEN-CONTROLLED ACCOMMODATION AND HAS A CLEANER$ BUT MANAGES ALL HER OTHER DAILY ACTIVITIES. SHE GOES TO THE BANK ONCE A WEEK$ AND TENDS TO DO HER OWN SHOPPING. SHE DOES NOT MIX VERY WELL WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE AT ~~ AS SHE FEELS THEY HAVE ALL LIVED IN ~ A LONG TIME AND KNOW EACH OTHER MUCH BETTER$ AND FEELS THAT SHE HAS DECREASED CONFIDENCE IN GOING INTO SOCIAL SITUATIONS. IT HAS ALSO BEEN NOTICED THAT ~ CAN GET CONFUSED ABOUT THE TIME - ON ONE OCCASION SHE THOUGHT HER SON HAD GONE AWAY ON HOLIDAY$ AND MORE RECENTLY HAD MIXED UP THE TIME OF DAY$ PHONING HER SON AT 10.00PM TO ASK WHY THE HAIRDRESSER HAD NOT TURNED UP. HER SHORT-TERM MEMORY IS IMPAIRED$ BUT HER LONG-TERM MEMORY APPEARS UNAFFECTED. THIS HAS BEEN A GRADUAL CHANGE OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO. MRS ~ HAS ALWAYS BEEN QUITE AN INDEPENDENT LADY$ WHO LIKES TO SORT OUT THINGS FOR HERSELF. SHE ALSO SUFFERS WITH MACULAR DEGENERATION AND IS REGISTERED BLIND$ BUT MANAGES QUITE WELL WITH THIS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY DEPRESSION. SHE SLEEPS WELL$ HER APPETITE IS GOOD$ AND HER WEIGHT IS STEADY. SHE ENJOYS LIFE AND CAN BE CHEERFUL AT TIMES. SHE CONCENTRATES WELL. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY SHE HAS MACULAR DEGENERATION$ HYPOKALAEMIA$ AND HYPOTHYROIDISM. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY NIL OF NOTE. FAMILY HISTORY I GATHER THAT HER PARENTS DIED WHEN THEY WERE ELDERLY. SHE HAD SEVEN SIBLINGS$ THREE OF WHOM ARE STILL ALIVE$ AND THERE IS NO HISTORY OF MEMORY PROBLEMS. DRUG HISTORY THYROXINE 75MCG$ AND FELODIPINE MR 5MG I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE IN A DOSETTE BOX$ BUT DESPITE THIS SHE HAS ON OCCASION TAKEN MORE THAN THE PRESCRIBED DOSE. PERSONAL HISTORY SHE WAS BORN IN ~ NEAR ~. SHE MARRIED DURING THE WAR$ AND HAS BEEN A WIDOW SINCE 1969. HER HUSBAND WAS A ~. SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN - A SON WHO IS MARRIED AND LIVES IN ~ AND HAS TWO CHILDREN$ AND A DAUGHTER WHO UNFORTUNATELY DIED IN 1994 OF CANCER. ~ IS A NON-SMOKER AND JUST TAKES OCCASIONAL ALCOHOL. MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION THIS REVEALED A NEATLY DRESSED LADY WITH MODEST RAPPORT. THERE WERE NO PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS$ AND HER MOOD APPEARED EUTHYMIC. MMSE REVEALED A SCORE OF 19/30. IMPRESSION AND PLAN I THINK THIS LADY DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT MEMORY IMPAIRMENT$ ALTHOUGH SHE FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AND ACCEPT THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR HELP IN THE FUTURE. I NOTE THAT ALL THE BLOOD TESTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ARE ESSENTIALLY NORMAL. I THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR ~ TO HAVE A TRIAL OF MEDICATION$ TO WHICH SHE AGREED. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD PRESCRIBE THIS SO THAT IT CAN BE PLACED DIRECTLY IN HER DOSETTE BOX$ AS HER SON ALREADY HAS SOME CONCERNS THAT SHE MAY ON OCCASION TAKE MORE THAN ONE DAY'S DOSAGE. I WOULD SUGGEST ARICEPT 5MG INITIALLY$ INCREASING TO 10MG AFTER THE FIRST MONTH IF SHE TOLERATES THIS. I WILL REVIEW HER AGAIN IN THE MEMORY CLINIC IN THREE MONTHS TIME$ AND WILL ALSO ARRANGE FOR THE DAY SERVICES TO ASSESS THIS LADY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN ENCOURAGE MORE COMMUNITY ACTIVITY.

I VISITED HIM AT HOME WITH MY COLLEAGUE ~~$ STAFF NURSE. MRS ~ WAS ALSO PRESENT. MR ~ PRESENTED AS A FRIENDLY GENTLEMAN WHO WAS UNAWARE OF THE REASON FOR THE VISIT. MRS ~ SAID THAT HE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONFUSED. HE CAN BECOME DISORIENTATED TO THE TIME AT NIGHT AND SOMETIMES CANNOT FIND THE TOILET. HE HAS NOT ATTEMPTED TO GET UP AND GET DRESSED ONCE HE HAS BEEN RE-ORIENTATED AND HE RETURNS TO SLEEP. HIS DAUGHTERS VISIT WEEKLY AND ALTHOUGH HE RECOGNISES THEM HE CANNOT ALWAYS RECALL WHO THEY ARE OR THEIR NAMES. DURING THE ASSESSMENT TODAY BOTH HIS LONG AND SHORT TERM MEMORY WAS IMPAIRED. HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE HAD SPENT CHRISTMAS AND BOXING DAY AT HIS DAUGHTERS. HIS SPEECH WAS NORMAL IN RATE BUT VAGUE. HE WAS UNABLE TO RETAIN ANY COMPLEX INFORMATION AND WHEN ASKING QUESTIONS COULD ONLY RESPOND TO ONE QUESTION AT A TIME. A FULL ADDENBROOKES COGNITIVE EXAMINATION WAS NOT COMPLETED DUE TO HIS IMPAIRED COGNITION. ON COMPLETION OF THE MMSE HE SCORED 13/30. MR ~ WAS DISORIENTED TO THE DATE BUT HE COULD RECALL THE MONTH AND YEAR. HE WAS UNABLE TO REMEMBER HIS ADDRESS BUT DURING THE DAY HE CAN FIND HIS WAY INSIDE THE BUNGALOW. MR ~ NEEDED 3 WORDS REPEATED ONCE AND HE COULD NOT RETAIN ALL THREE LONG ENOUGH TO RECALL THESE. HE WAS UNABLE TO INITIATE WRITING A SENTENCE AND WHEN ASKED TO READ AN INSTRUCTION AND ACT ON THIS HE ONLY READ THE INSTRUCTION. MR ~ HAS HEARING AND SIGHT PROBLEMS BUT THESE DID NOT APPEAR TO EFFECT THE RESULTS. HE WAS UNABLE TO RECOGNISE FAMILY MEMBERS IN PHOTOS MR ~ LIVES WITH HIS WIFE. MR ~ IS INDEPENDENT IN PERSONAL CARE AND MRS ~ CONFIRMED THIS$ HOWEVER HE RELIES ON HER FOR ALL HIS DOMESTIC CARE NEEDS. HIS MOBILITY IS POOR AND HE CANNOT WALK FURTHER THAT HIS FRONT BOUNDARY. DURING THE VISIT WHEN HE WENT TO THE TOILET HE LEANED OVER TO THE RIGHT AND HE HAS SLID OFF THE BED A COUPLE OF TIMES. HE DOES NOT GO OUT UNLESS HIS DAUGHTERS TAKE HIM. MRS ~ SAID THAT SHE IS MANAGING AT HOME AND WAS CONCERNED THAT MR ~ WOULD BE MADE TO GO INTO RESIDENTIAL CARE. MRS ~ ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY COULD DO WITH SOME HELP IN THE HOME AND HAS AGREED FOR ~ TO REFER THEM BOTH TO SOCIAL CARE ~. THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A FULL ASSESSMENT FOR MR ~$ A CARERS ASSESSMENT FOR MRS ~ AND AN OCCUPATIONAL ASSESSMENT FOR ADAPTATIONS AND EQUIPMENT IN THE HOME. DAYCARE WAS DISCUSSED BUT MR ~ IS RELUCTANT TO LEAVE HIS HOME HOWEVER HE WOULD AGREE TO SOMEONE STAYING WITH HIM TO ALLOW MRS ~ TO GO OUT. MRS ~ ONLY LEAVES HIM FOR SHORT PERIODS WHILE SHE GOES TO THE LOCAL SHOPS. THEIR DAUGHTERS VISIT EVERY FRIDAY AND DO THE SHOPPING AND ANY CHORES AS NEEDED. MR ~ MEDICATION IS DELIVERED IN A BLISTER PACK AND MRS ~ ADMINISTERS THIS. THEY HAVE LIFE LINE IN SITU HOWEVER AS MR ~ IS UNABLE TO USE THIS MRS ~ WEARS THE PENDANT. HE HAS A GOOD APPETITE AND HIS MOOD AND PERSONALITY IS THE SAME AS IT WAS PRIOR TO ANY MEMORY LOSS. MR ~ HAS A HISTORY OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE$ AORTIC ANEURISM REQUIRING STENTING AND HAS HAD A CORONARY BYPASS GRAFT. HE ALSO HAS CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND IS TYPE 2 DIABETIC. HIS DIABETES IS MONITORED BY THE DIABETIC NURSE. FOLLOWING A DISCUSSION WITH DR ~$ CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST FOR THE ELDERLY$ HE HAS CONFIRMED THAT MR ~ HAS MODERATE TO SEVERE DEMENTIA OF PREDOMINANTLY VASCULAR AETIOLOGY. AS SUCH AND IN VIEW OF THE SEVERITY HE WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE FOR ANTI-DEMENTIA MEDICATION. I AM THEREFORE DISCHARGING MR ~ BACK TO YOUR CARE.

I VISITED HER AT ~~~ HOME ON ~/06/2010. MRS ~ PRESENTED AS A FRIENDLY LADY WHO HAS PARTIAL INSIGHT INTO HER MEMORY DEFICITS. SHE REPORTED THAT HER MEMORY WAS NOT GOOD BUT FELT THAT THIS WAS RELATED TO HER AGE. CARE STAFF AT ~~ HOMES HAVE NOTICED A RAPID DETERIORATION SINCE SHE ATTENDED AN OPEN DAY IN MARCH. MRS ~ HAS BEEN ON THE WAITING LIST FOR THE HOME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HAS OFTEN VISITED FRIENDS SO THE STAFF HAVE GOT TO KNOW HER WELL. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOME 4 WEEKS AGO FOR A TRIAL PERIOD AND ON ARRIVAL SHE WAS MUCH MORE CONFUSED AND DISORIENTATED THAN PREVIOUS. HER HOME CARER WHO VISITS HAS SAID THAT SHE SEEMED TO SUDDENLY DETERIORATE ABOUT 1 WEEK BEFORE ADMISSION. SHE NOW CANNOT INITIATE TASKS INCLUDING FEEDING HERSELF WITHOUT PROMPTS AND SHE HAS LOST HER ABILITY TO SEQUENCE A TASK. DURING THE ASSESSMENT TODAY HER LONG TERM MEMORY WAS INTACT AND HER SPEECH WAS NORMAL IN RATE AND CONTENT WITH GOOD COMPREHENSION ALTHOUGH STAFF REPORT THAT THIS CAN FLUCTUATE. SHE WAS ORIENTATED TO PLACE BUT SINCE ARRIVING AT ~~HOMES ALTHOUGH SHE HAS LEARNT HER WAY FROM HER ROOM TO THE DINING ROOM SHE IS UNABLE TO FIND HER WAY TO THE TOILET ONCE THERE. SHE HAD SOME DEFICITS WITH ORIENTATION TO DATE. ON COMPLETION OF THE ~ COGNITIVE EXAMINATION SHE SCORED MMSE 22/30$ ACE 60/100. HER MAIN AREAS OF DEFICITS WERE IN MEMORY RECALL$ VERBAL FLUENCY AND VISUOSPACIAL ABILITIES. DURING THE PAST FEW WEEKS SHE HAS BEEN FOUND CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR A FEW TIMES DURING BOTH DAY AND NIGHT. ONCE SHE HAD HER CLOTHES OVER HER PYJAMAS. MRS ~ REMEMBERS ONE INCIDENT AND SAID THAT HER GP VISITED FOLLOWING THIS BUT SHE CANNOT RECALL IN HAPPENING AGAIN AND FELT THIS WAS DUE TO HER DISORIENTATION ON ARRIVING AT THE HOME. PLACEMENT DUE TO HER MEMORY LOSS AND AT HER CURRENT LEVEL OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION SHE WOULD BE BEST PLACED IN A EMI HOME. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH DR ~$ STAFF GRADE PSYCHIATRIST$ MRS ~ COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IS VASCULAR IN ORIGIN AND WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE FOR ANT-DEMENTIA MEDICATION.

MR ~ WAS GIVEN A SIX WEEK SUPPLY OF THE MEDICATION AND HE WILL BE REVIEWED AT THE CLINIC FOR TOLERABILITY$ SIDE-EFFECTS AND POSSIBLE TITRATION OF THE DOSE. DR ~ CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST FOR THE ELDERLY FROM CLIENT: MMSE 26/30 (~.01.06) SCORE IN MILD RANGE ~ IS AN 81 YEAR OLD GENTLEMAN REFERRED BY NURSE PRACTITIONER VIA ~ MEDICAL CENTRE IN OCTOBER 2005.

THERE IS A HISTORY OF LOWERED MOOD FOLLOWING A SERIES OF PHYSICAL ILLNESSES AND HE HAS RECEIVED TREATMENT FOR THIS ON AND OFF OVER THE YEARS. 04.01.06 ~ WAS A WELL-PRESENTED$ COOPERATIVE MAN WITH A WARM PERSONALITY. HIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED NORMALLY AND HE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION. HE ADMITTED SOME NERVES BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT BUT DID NOT APPEAR OVERLY ANXIOUS. SAID HE WAS A NERVOUS PERSON AND CAN GET UPTIGHT ABOUT THINGS. REPORTED A DROP IN CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO PROTECT HIMSELF SHOULD HE BE ATTACKED DUE TO BEING PHYSICALLY FRAILER. HE SAID HIS THOUGHTS COME MORE SLOWLY THAN THEY USED TO DO AND THUS HE PONDERS MORE WHEN MAKING DECISIONS. DENIED FEELING SAD OR DEPRESSED$ DENIED SUICIDAL IDEATION. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE FUTURE HE SAID 'I CAN SEE IT'S NOT LIMITLESS .. DON'T THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE$ GRATEFUL FOR WHAT I GET.' WHEN ASKED HOW HE FELT HIS MEMORY WAS HE CONCEDED THAT HE DID HAVE DIFFICULTIES RECALLING RECENTLY HELD CONVERSATIONS AND EVENTS AND FELT THAT HE COPED WITH THE SITUATION WELL ENOUGH BUT RECOGNISED THAT THAT IT CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR HIS FAMILY AND THOSE AROUND HIM. HE DESCRIBED THE ONSET AS VERY GRADUAL STARTING ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO WITH HIS MEMORY CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE. HE WAS UNSURE AS TO THE CAUSE OF HIS MEMORY PROBLEMS BUT QUESTIONED WHETHER HIS HEART ATTACKS AND STROKE MAY BE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. ON COGNITIVE EXAMINATION ~'S SCORE SUGGESTS A MILD IMPAIRMENT. HE WAS NEARLY ORIENTED TO TIME AND PLACE MAKING ONLY SLIGHT ERRORS WITH THE YEAR BELIEVING IT TO BE 2002 AND THE ADDRESS DESCRIBING IT AS ~ WHEN WE WERE ON ~ STREET.

HE ALSO TENDS TO HAVE ONE MAIN FOCUS OF THOUGHT WHICH HE WILL FREQUENTLY REFER TO UNTIL IT IS SUPERSEDED BY SOMETHING ELSE E.G. HE WAS VERY FOCUSED ON A BURST WATER PIPE AT HIS HOUSE OVER THE XMAS PERIOD AND WOULD FREQUENTLY REFER TO THIS BUT LATER HE BECAME FOCUSED ON HIS APPOINTMENT WITH THE MEMORY SERVICE AND SHIFTED HIS ATTENTION TO FOCUS TO THIS; HE HAS DIFFICULTY CONTEMPLATING OTHER MATTERS. HIS MOOD IS PRESENTLY DESCRIBED AS STABLE ALTHOUGH THERE IS A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION WHICH HAS BEEN TREATED WITH MEDICATION ON AND OFF OVER THE YEARS.

OTHER DIFFICULTIES WITH MEMORY INCLUDE AN INABILITY TO RECALL WHEN HE HAS LAST HEARD OR SEEN FAMILY MEMBERS DESPITE THEIR FREQUENT CONTACT. HE WILL GO TO THE SHOPS AND BUY THE PAPERS BUT WILL LATER FORGET HE HAS DONE SO AND WILL GO OUT AND BUY THEM AGAIN.

HER HUSBAND AGREES WITH THIS BUT GETS ANNOYED WITH HER REPEATED QUESTIONS AND HER INABILITY TO RELATE TO THE PRESENT. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN THERE WERE SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND SHE WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM CORRECTLY. SHE WAS ALSO ABLE TO TELL ME SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE GOING FOR THEIR FLU INJECTION WHEN I LEFT. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY HER HUSBAND. WHEN ASKED ABOUT HER EARLY MORNING WAKENING SHE INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAVE TWO CATS$ ONE OF WHICH ALWAYS WAKES HER IN THE MORNING BY 'PAWING' HER FACE. SHE IS FRIGHTENED THAT HE WILL ACCIDENTALLY SCRATCH HER SO SHE GETS UP. ONCE IN THE KITCHEN SHE MAKES THE BREAKFAST AND THEN WAKES HER HUSBAND TO COME FOR HIS.

SHE COMPLAINED OF A DISTURBED SLEEP PATTERN$ REDUCED DIET AND FLUID INTAKE$ LACK OF CONCENTRATION AND LETHARGY THIS MAY INDICATE A DEPRESSIVE EPISODE WHICH WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN SOME REDUCTION IN HER COGNITIVE FUNCTION BUT NOT ALL. FOR EXAMPLE$ IF HER CONCENTRATION IS POOR SHE MAY NOT REMEMBER THINGS SO WELL AND REPEATEDLY ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS. SHE HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED ANTIDEPRESSANTS BY DR ~ BUT HER HUSBAND HAS ONLY BEEN GIVING HER THEM OCCASIONALLY AS HE THOUGHT THEY WERE SLEEPING PILLS$ THEREFORE THEY HAVE BEEN OF NO USE WHATSOEVER. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SOME COGNITIVE DECLINE WITH THIS LADY BUT I ALSO SUSPECT THAT SHE MAY HAVE AN UNDERLYING DEPRESSION. IT MAY BE PRUDENT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER REINSTATING THE MIRTAZAPINE. ON A REGULAR BASIS IT MAY IMPROVE HER MOOD AND HER SLEEPING PATTERN.

TO LET YOU KNOW$ RECENT HEPATITIS CMV IN EBV SEROLOGY HAS BEEN NEGATIVE FOR ANY ACUTE INFECTIONS. HIS SEROPLASMIN IS JUST ON THE UPPER LIMIT OF NORMAL AT 0.41 (0.4). AUTOANTIBODY SCREEN$ LGG AND IGM AND ANKA ARE ALL NEGATIVE; HIS IGA IS SLIGHTLY RAISED AT 4.95 BUT I DON'T SUSPECT THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED A PARAPROTEIN BUT ONLY FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE OF THE IGA. CRP IS DOWN TO 22$ HIS FERRITIN IS NORMAL AT 128$ U&ES ARE NORMAL. RED BLOOD CELL FOLATE NORMAL. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITIES AT THIS STAGE WOULD SEEM TO BE A MILD NORMOCYTIC ANAEMIA WITH A HAEMOGLOBIN OF 12.1 AND A PERSISTENTLY RAISED ESR OF 64. THE CHEST X-RAY DONE IN JANUARY NEEDS TO BE FORMALLY REPORTED AND I HAVE REQUESTED THIS TODAY$ JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY. CLINICALLY$ THINGS ARE UNCHANGED; HIS WEIGHT IS STEADY$ HE IS QUITE CHEERFUL AND HE IS EATING WELL AT HOME. THE INITIAL DISCOMFORT AROUND THE LEFT GROIN AREA$ FOR WHICH HE WAS INITIALLY REFERRED TO THE SURGEONS$ HAS VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED NOW. HIS BOWELS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TEMPERAMENTAL AT 3-4 DAYS AND THERE ARE NO FEVERS OR NIGHT SWEATS. ON EXAMINATION$ HE LOOKS WELL; HEART RATE IS 80 IN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION; JVP IS DOWN$ HEART SOUNDS ARE NORMAL WITH NO ADDED SOUNDS AND THERE IS NO PERIPHERAL OEDEMA. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT LYMPHADENOPATHY AROUND HIS NECK. I EXAMINED THE INGUINAL REGIONS AGAIN AND I AM NOT CONVINCED OF SIGNIFICANT ADENOPATHY AND I THINK THERE IS SOME BULKINESS DOWN HERE WHICH I THINK IS FEMORAL SHEATH$ AND EVEN LESS SO ON THE LEFT SIDE WHICH I THINK IS NORMAL. I COULD PALPATE THE LIVER EDGE ON ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION WHICH IS OTHERWISE SOFT AND NON-TENDER. THE TESTES WERE UNREMARKABLE. IN SUMMARY$ I HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN CONVINCED BY THE REPORT OF CLINICAL ADENOPATHY AND THE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND IS UNREMARKABLE IN THIS RESPECT. THIS HAS SHOWN A SLIGHTLY ENLARGED LIVER WITH A NORMAL SPLEEN. HE DOES HAVE A PERSISTENTLY RAISED ESR AND A MILD TO NORMAL CHROMIC ANAEMIA. ABOVE ALL$ HE REMAINS CLINICALLY UNCHANGED. I AM GOING TO GET THE CHEST X-RAY REPORT AND REPEAT THE ESR$ CRP AND FULL BLOOD COUNT AND SOME TOXOPLASMA SEROLOGY AND A URINE BENCE JONES PROTEIN FOR COMPLETENESS. I AM ALSO GOING TO ORGANISE AN ULTRASOUND OF THE RIGHT AND LEFT GROIN JUST TO RULE OUT THE QUESTION OF ANY POSSIBLE LYMPHADENOPATHY WHICH I THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE.

HE HAS HAD A RECENT ADMISSION TO ~ HOSPITAL WITH CONFUSION SECONDARY TO A URINARY TRACT INFECTION$ AND HE WENT ON TO ~  A&E DEPARTMENT FOR 24 HOURS BUT IS BETTER NOW. HE HAS RECENTLY BEEN A LITTLE CONSTIPATED AND IS BEING TREATED WITH ENEMAS BY YOURSELVES. THERE ARE NO NEW SYMPTOMS. A RECENT ULTRASOUND OF HIS GROINS HAS DEMONSTRATED AN INDIRECT RIGHT INGUINAL HERNIA BUT CERTAINLY NO LYMPHADENOPATHY$ AND IN FACT I DO NOT THINK WE EVER FOUND ANY. L-SPINE RADIOLOGY HAS SHOWN LOSS OF T12 AND L1 WITH ANTERIOR WEDGING AND THE BONES ARE GENERALLY OSTEOPENIC$ ALL CONSISTENT WITH OSTEOPOROTIC COLLAPSE.

HE IS NOW B12 DEFICIENT WITH B12 OF 136$ FERRITIN 128 WITH LOW IRON AND TRANSFERRIN SATURATION (8.3 AND 16% RESPECTIVELY) SO HE IS ALSO IRON DEFICIENT. HIS RED CELL FOLATE WAS NORMAL IN APRIL AT 159. CHEST X-RAY FROM JANUARY HAS BEEN REPORTED AS SHOWING VERY SLIGHT SHADOWING IN HIS LEFT COSTOPHRENIC ANGLE WITH SOME PATCHY CONSOLIDATION WITH THE LUNGS OTHERWISE CLEAR AND NORMAL HEART SIZE. HIS WEIGHT TODAY IS 74.8 KG$ BLOOD PRESSURE 141/63$ HEART RATE 72. IN SUMMARY$ WE HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED ANY LYMPHADENOPATHY. HE IS B12 DEFICIENT AND SLIGHTLY IRON DEFICIENT. HE HAS NEVER REALLY HAD ANY NEW SYMPTOMATOLOGY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE FINDINGS. HE ALSO HAS OSTEOPOROSIS OF THE SPINE. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD ORGANISE AND PRESCRIBE A REPLETION COURSE OF B12 BY INJECTION AND SOME IRON SULPHATE SUPPLEMENTATION AFTER HIS CONSTIPATION IS CLEARED.

THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS BASED ON INFORMATION GATHERED FROM MR ~~$ HIS SON AND MY ASSESSMENT AND EXAMINATION OF HIM TODAY. HE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AND SUFFERED FROM VASCULAR DEMENTIA FIVE YEARS AGO BY DR ~~ IN OUR OUTPATIENT'S CLINIC. THE REASON FOR THE APPOINTMENT / REVIEW REQUESTED: 1. TO ESTABLISH WHETHER HE IS SUITABLE FOR ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE MEDICATION 2. TO ASSESS IF HE HAS CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISION REGARDING INSTRUCTING A LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY. OTHER THAN THAT$ THIS GENTLEMAN IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF BY HIS SON. APART FROM REPORTS OF SHORT TERM MEMORY IMPAIRMENT THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER CONCERNS EXPRESSED. ON FURTHER QUESTIONING THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN HIS BIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS. HE HAS GOT AN EXTENSIVE RNEDICAI HISTORY AND A LONG LIST OF MEDICATION INCLUDING ANTI-THRUMBOTIC AGENTS. HE IS ALSO AN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC. HIS BACKGROUND INFORMATION INCLUDES THAT HE WORKED AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER ALL HIS LIFE. SINCE WIDOWED HE HAS MOVED TO LIVE WITH HIS SON ~$ FROM ~. HE HAS LIVED WITH HIM FOR 10 YEARS NOW. HE HAS THREE SONS$ ~ BEING THE OLDEST OF THE THREE. THE CURRENT CARE PACKAGE INCLUDES: 1. SOCIAL SERVICES ONCE DAILY FOR PERSONAL CARE. 2. AN HOUR A WEEK FOR HOUSE CLEANING. 3. HE USED TO ATTEND ~~ WHICH HE HAS STOPPED NOW. HOWEVER$ A SIT-IN SERVICE IS CONSIDERED CURRENTLY ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT STARTED YET. LOOKING AT HIS PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS TODAY$ HE WAS IN THE WHEELCHAIR WITH VERY COMPROMISED MOBILITY. HE HAS POOR VISION DUE TO CATARACT SURGERY. HIS HEARING WAS GOOD. HE IS USUALLY CONTINENT; HOWEVER$ SON REPORTED SOME URINARY INCONTINENCE DURING UTI AND MORE ON ACUTE THEN CHRONIC STATE. THE MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION REVEALED A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS WELL KEMPT AND WELL DRESSED. I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP A GOOD RAPPORT. HE HAD EXTREMELY GOOD EYE CONTACT. THERE WERE NO ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS. HIS SPEECH WAS NORMAL IN RATE AND RHYTHM WITH GAPS IN SHORT-TERM MEMORY. HE ONLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT HE MANAGED TO REMEMBER. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF BIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. NO EVIDENCE OF PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. I PERFORMED A DETAILED COGNITIVE EXAMINATION$ WHERE HIS ORIENTATION TO TIME WAS 1/5$ PLACE WAS 3/5$ HE WAS ABLE TO REGISTER ALL THREE OBJECTS$ HIS ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION WAS GOOD$ PARTICULARLY GOING THROUGH THE DAYS OF THE WEEK BACKWARDS$ RECALL WAS 0/3. HE COULD NOT DRAW THE CLOCK FACE OR COPY THE INTERLOCKING PENTAGON BASED ON EYESIGHT. HIS OVERALL SCORE WAS 18/27$ MAKING IT MILD TO MODERATE DEGREE OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. HE ALSO HAD A VERY GOOD INSIGHT INTO HIS DIFFICULTIES AND WE WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS ALL THAT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. IN SUMMARY$ THIS IS A 93-YEAR-OLD RETIRED ENGINEER$ WIDOWER$ WITH DIAGNOSIS OF VASCULAR DEMENTIA FROM FIVE YEARS AGO$ PRESENTING WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY IMPAIRMENT. TOTAL CARE IS PROVIDED BY HIS SORT WHO IS 24-HOUR CARER AND CARE PACKAGE. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HIS VASCULAR DEMENTIA / MULTIINFARCT DEMENTIA REMAINS REASONABLY STABLE WITH NO RISKS AND ALL THE NEEDS MET. THE FOLLOWING CARE PLAN HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND AGREED. CARE PLAN AGREED: 1. ONCE AGAIN WE DISCUSSED THE DIAGNOSIS. 2. I EXPLAINED THAT AS HE SUFFERS FROM VASCULAR DEMENTIA$ ANTI-CHOLINESTERASE MEDICATION WAS NOT INDICATED TO THIS GENTLEMAN. WE THEREFORE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALZHEIMER'S AND VASCULAR DEMENTIA AND POINTED TOWARDS HIS DIAGNOSIS OF VASCULAR TYPE OF DEMENTIA. 3. THERE ARE ALSO SOME CONCERNS REGARDING HIS LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY. HIS ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY IS CURRENTLY WITH HIS YOUNGER SON$ WHO IS NOT INVOLVED IN HIS CARE AT THIS STAGE. BASED ON THE ABOVE$ MR ~~ IS REQUESTING A CHANGE OF LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY. I THEREFORE HAVE TESTED / ASSESSED HIS CAPACITY TO INSTRUCT THE LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY TODAY. MR ~~ WAS OF UNDERSTANDING THAT ~$ HIS SON HAS GOT THE LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY$ RATHER THAN HIS YOUNGER SON ~. WHEN QUESTIONED OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY$ HIS WORDS WERE 'LEGAL ABILITY TO LOOK AFTER ONE'S AFFAIRS'. HE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT ENDURING / LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY MEANT AND PREFERRED ~$ HIS ELDEST SON$ TO DO THAT AS HE IS ALREADY ACTING ON HIS BEHALF WITH ALL THE MATTERS ANYWAY. BASED ON THE ABOVE$ I HAVE AGREED AND RECEIVED CONSENT FROM MR ~~$ TO COPY THIS REPORT TO ~~ AT ~~. SOLICITORS$ WHO IS ACTING ON THEIR BEHALF ON INSTRUCTING THE LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY. 4. BASED ON ALL THE ABOVE$ I DO NOT FEEL ANY ONGOING INTERVENTION IS INDICATED FROM OUR SERVICES. I HAVE ASSESSED AND DISCHARGED HIM AND I HAVE CLEARLY EXPLAINED THIS TO MR ~ SENIOR AND JUNIOR.

SHE HAS A 12 MONTH HISTORY OF FAIRLY ACUTE ONSET OF COGNITIVE DIFFICULTIES. THIS FOLLOWED ON FROM A COLLAPSE IN HER BEDROOM. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE ~ INFIRMARY WHERE SHE HAD SOME INVESTIGATIONS WHICH SHOWED NO OBVIOUS CAUSE. SINCE THEN SHE HAS HAD VERY MARKED ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS. THIS PARTLY COULD BE RELATED TO HER PERSONALITY IN THAT SHE HAS BEEN A VERY FIT AND WELL PERSON WHO HAS NEVER HAD TO GO INTO HOSPITAL BEFORE AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF BEING PHYSICALLY UNWELL AND AN INPATIENT IN HOSPITAL DID OVERWHELM HER. SHE HAS BEEN TREATED FOR HYPERTENSION IN THE PAST. SHE WAS COMMENCED ON CITALOPRAM APPROXIMATELY 9 WEEKS AGO WHICH INITIALLY APPEARED TO MAKE SOME OF HER ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WORSE. SINCE THEN HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN MOST AREAS INCLUDING HER APPETITE$ SLEEP PATTERN AND ANXIETY LEVELS. IT ALSO MUST BE RECOGNISED HOWEVER THAT DUE TO HER SON RETIRING HE HAS BEEN WITH HER FOR MOST OF THE TIME SINCE SHE HAS RETURNED HOME AND I AM SURE HIS NEAR CONSTANT PRESENCE IS A VERY REASSURING FACTOR FOR HER. HE HAS NOTICED SINCE THE COLLAPSE THAT SHE HAS BEEN FORGETTING THINGS SUCH AS HER OWN DATE OF BIRTH$ NAMES OF PLANTS AS SHE IS AN AVID WELL INFORMED GARDENER. SHE ALSO APPEARS DISORIENTATED AROUND HER OWN HOME. HER SHORT TERM MEMORY IS POOR AND HER HANDWRITING HAS MARKEDLY DETERIORATED IN THAT HE PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE DESCRIBED THIS AS BEING 'BEAUTIFUL'. AT THE TIME OF HER COLLAPSE SHE DID HAVE SLIGHT EYELID DROOP AND HER MOUTH WAS ALSO SLIGHTLY DROOPED AT THE SIDE. THERE IS NO HISTORY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN THE FAMILY BUT HER SISTER DID HAVE STROKES WHEN SHE WAS OLDER. I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE IS ALSO BEING FOLLOWED UP BY DOCTOR ~ AT THE ~ INFIRMARY. COGNITIVE TESTING HAS INDICATED A SCORE OF 22/30 ON THE MMSE AND 54/100 ON THE ADDENBROOKS. SHE SHOWS MARKED PROBLEMS WITH SHORT TERM MEMORY$ SOME DISORIENTATION IN TIME AND CONCENTRATION DIFFICULTIES. SHE HAS MARKED REDUCTION IN VERBAL FLUENCY$ SOME PROBLEMS WITH WORD FINDING DIFFICULTIES AND IMPAIRED VISUO/SPATIAL SKILLS. HER COGNITIVE PROFILE AND BACKGROUND HISTORY IS VERY SUGGESTIVE OF ACUTE ONSET VASCULAR DEMENTIA. IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT SHE DOES HAVE A MIXED DEMENTIA. AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT WITH HER HIGH ANXIETY LEVELS IT DOES NOT FEEL APPROPRIATE TO ARRANGE SCANNING. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE THE MAIN TESTER AS FAR AS WHETHER SHE IS VIABLE TO COPE ON HER OWN WILL BE WHEN HER SON SPENDS A FORTNIGHT AWAY FROM HER HOME. I THINK THIS WILL GIVE THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE INDICATION AS TO WHETHER WE ARE LOOKING AT SUPPORTING HER IN HER OWN HOME OR WHETHER WE HAVE TO LOOK TOWARDS MORE RADICAL OPTIONS SUCH AS A MOVE INTO RESIDENTIAL CARE.

TP14956,13667383,383,20383,2,1922,83,1,1943,22,1,31,357666,DR ~~ PSYCHIATRY OF ~~ 29/07/05 THANK YOU FOR REFERRING THIS 82 YEAR OLD LADY WITH MEMORY DIFFICULTIES TO OUR SERVICE. I SAW HER IN CLINIC ON THE 19TH JULY WHEN SHE ATTENDED WITH HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW EXPLAINED THAT THEY NOTICED PROBLEMS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO ALTHOUGH THINGS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY WORSE OVER THE LAST YEAR. THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN INSIDIOUS ONSET BUT THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW DID DESCRIBE WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A STEPWISE COURSE. SHE REPORTED NO PROBLEMS WITH LONG TERM MEMORY BUT THAT HER SHORT TERM MEMORY WAS INCREASINGLY POOR THOUGH MRS ~ WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS HERSELF. SHE APPARENTLY GETS HER DAYS MUDDLED AND HER FAMILY WRITE THINGS FOR HER ON A BOARD ALTHOUGH SHE DOESN'T OFTEN REMEMBER TO LOOK AT THIS. SHE REQUIRES CONSTANT REMINDERS. THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH FINE MOTOR SKILLS BUT ON ONE OCCASION WHEN SHE STAYED WITH A FRIEND SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION WHEN AT THE GP SURGERY SHE COULD NOT WORK OUT HOW TO GET HOME. THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOURS ALTHOUGH SHE HAS LEFT TAPS ON AT HOME. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL PROBLEMS THAT CAUSE HER CONCERN. HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW REPORTED THAT SHE DOES NOT LIKE TO BE ALONE AND WILL REGULARLY PHONE. THERE IS A PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY OF DEPRESSION WHICH WAS TREATED WITH MEDICATION ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO. SHE WAS ALSO LOW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS ILL. I NOTE A HISTORY OF DIABETES AND SHE HAS AN ILEOSTOMY. THERE WAS A NOTE FROM 1985 OF THE DIAGNOSIS OF COPD AND SHE HAD A TIA IN 2002 WHEN SHE DEVELOPED A STIFF ARM AND 'CAME OVER PECULIAR'. HER MEDICATION HISTORY IS GLICLAZIDE 60MG BD$ LISINOPRIL 5MG MANE$ ROSIGLITAZONE 8MG MANE$ SIMVASTATIN 20MG NOCTE$ MEBEVERINE 135MG TDS$ ASPRIN 75MG ONCE A DAY$ BECLOMETASONE INHALER$ ALPHAGAN EYE DROPS. THERE IS NO FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY. HER FATHER DIED IN HIS SEVENTIES OF A CHEST INFECTION AND WORKED IN THE BUILDING TRADE. HER MOTHER WAS A LAUNDRY WORKER WHO DIED OF OLD AGE IN HER EIGHTIES. SHE HAS A HALF SISTER WHO DIED 10 YEARS AGO AND A BROTHER WHO HAS DIED. SHE WAS BORN IN ~  AND DESCRIBED BEING HAPPY AS A CHILD. SHE LEFT SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF 14 WHEN SHE STARTED SOME EVENING CLASSES. DURING THE WAR SHE WORKED IN A FACTORY MAKING BULLETS AND AFTER THE WAR SHE WORKED FOR ~. SHE WAS MARRIED AGED 40 AND HER HUSBAND WORKED WITH MACHINERY$ THEY HAVE ONE SON. SHE LIVES IN HER OWN FLAT AND HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW ~ HELPS WITH CLEANING. HER SON ~HELPS WITH THE MONEY. THERE IS NO GAS IN THE FLAT. SHE DOES NOT SMOKE OR DRINK AND HAS NO FINANCIAL CONCERNS. SHE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY HOBBIES OR INTERESTS BUT IS CONTENTED WITH BEING AT HOME. SHE ATTENDS THE BLIND CLUB ON A THURSDAY MORNING AND SOMETIMES ON A TUESDAY THEY HAVE OUTINGS. ON THE MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION SHE SHOWED GOOD SELF CARE AND WAS APPROPRIATE THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW. SHE DESCRIBED HER MOOD AS UP AND DOWN AND OBJECTIVELY I FOUND HER TO BE EUTHYMIC AND REACTIVE. THERE WERE NO BIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF DEPRESSION$ ALTHOUGH SHE DID SAY SHE STILL THINKS ABOUT HER HUSBAND A LOT. SHE GETS QUITE ANXIOUS AT NEW THINGS THAT BREAK HER ROUTINE AND HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW EXPLAINED THAT SHE WOULD SOMETIMES ACCUSE PEOPLE OF STEALING FROM HER WHEN SHE CAN'T FIND WHERE THINGS HAVE GONE. SHE DOES NOT HOWEVER HAVE MORE WIDESPREAD PARANOID OR PERSECUTORY IDEAS. SHE WAS QUITE AGREEABLE TO COGNITIVE TESTING AND SHE SCORED 19 OUR 30 ON MMSE AND 9 ON THE DEMTECT. SHE LOST MARKS ON ORIENTATION IN TIME AND PLACE AND RECALL. SHE COULD NOT REPEAT MY SENTENCE AND HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH CONSTRUCTIONAL DYSPRAXIA. SHE DREW A GOOD CLOCK FACE BUT WAS UNABLE TO PUT THE HANDS IN THE CORRECT POSITIONS AND IN FACT DREW THREE HANDS. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT MRS ~ HAS A MILD TO MODERATE DEMENTIA AND AS YOU SUGGEST IN HER REFERRAL THIS IS MOST LIKELY TO BE OF A VASCULAR TYPE. I WONDER HOWEVER IF IT MIGHT BE A MIXED DEMENTIA WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND I HAVE THEREFORE ARRANGED FOR HER TO HAVE A CT HEAD SCAN AND I WILL REVIEW HER IN CLINIC WHEN I HAVE THE RESULTS OF THIS.,9N36.00,Letter from specialist,38562,38567,TP

MEDICATION: STARTED TODAY EXELON (RIVASTIGMINE) PATCH 5CM2 SIZE (4.6MG PER 24 HOURS) - 2 X TWO WEEK PRESCRIPTIONS GIVEN TODAY. ALSO ON CO-CODAMOL PRN$ ZOPICLONE 3.75MG NOCTE AND RANITIDINE 150MG NOCTE. CARE PLAN: 1. TRIAL OF EXELON PATCH AS ABOVE. 2. REVIEW IN THE OUTPATIENT CLINIC IN FOUR WEEKS TIME. 3. ASKED TO CONTACT ME IF THERE ARE ANY DIFFICULTIES IN THE MEANTIME. I SAW MR ~ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE OUTPATIENT CLINIC WITH HIS WIFE ON 24TH APRIL 2008. HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSESSED BY MY COLLEAGUE ~~ (OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST) IN JANUARY AND SHE HAD FOUND MODERATE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT ON AN ADDENBROOKE'S COGNITIVE EXAMINATION (59/100) AND SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT ON A MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION (23/30). THE MEMORY DIFFICULTIES STARTED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO BUT HAVE BEEN DETERIORATING MORE RAPIDLY RECENTLY. IT IS MAINLY SHORT-TERM MEMORY WITH DISORIENTATION. HE LOSES THINGS$ BELIEVES THAT FURNITURE HAS BEEN MOVED AROUND AND OCCASIONALLY DOES NOT RECOGNISE HIS WIFE. IN ADDITION HE HAS AT TIMES BELIEVED THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE PRESENT IN HIS HOME AND HE HAS SEEN A STRANGE LADY COMING TO TEA AND SITTING ON THE SETTEE. THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENT RECENTLY. HE HAD A PERIOD OF LABYRINTHITIS RECENTLY LEADING TO A FEW FALLS BUT HE HAS NOT LOST HIS BALANCE FOR SOME MONTHS NOW. I NOTE THERE IS NO HISTORY OF PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE$ BRADYCARDIA OR ASTHMA/COAD. IN ADDITION THERE IS NO HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION$ HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA$ CVA'S OR TIA'S. THERE IS NO ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE EITHER. MRS ~ HAS PARKINSON'S DISEASE$ WHICH REDUCES HER MOBILITY. THEY HAVE A PRIVATE CARER EVERY MORNING FOR ONE HOUR AND ALSO SOMEBODY DOES THE SHOPPING FOR THEM. THEY DO NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE VERY MUCH NOW DUE TO POOR MOBILITY. I NOTE MR ~ IS ALSO A LITTLE DEAF. MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION REVEALED A KEMPT GENTLEMAN WITH GOOD SELF-CARE. HE WAS PLEASANT AND CO-OPERATIVE WITH NO ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS. HE ENGAGED WELL WITH GOOD EYE CONTACT. I NOTE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PARKINSONISM AND HE WALKED REASONABLY WELL WITH A STICK. HIS SPEECH WAS NORMAL$ AFFECT REACTIVE IF A LITTLE PERPLEXED AT TIMES AND MOOD EUTHYMIC. HE WAS NOT PSYCHOTIC OR SUICIDAL. HE WAS DISORIENTATED AND HAD POOR SHORT-TERM MEMORY. MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION GAVE A SCORE OF 22/30. HOWEVER THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL DETERIORATION AND THE ADDENBROOKE'S INDICATES MODERATE IMPAIRMENT. WE DISCUSSED THE MECHANISM OF ACTION AND SIDE EFFECT OF TREATMENT WITH THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS. AFTER DISCUSSING THE VARIOUS OPTIONS MR AND MRS ~ PREFERRED TO TRY THE PATCH FORMULATION. I HAVE WARNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GI UPSET AND BRADYCARDIA. I HAVE ASKED THEM TO CALL ME IF THERE ARE ANY DIFFICULTIES. I WILL SEE THEM BOTH AGAIN IN APPROXIMATELY FOUR WEEKS WHEN I WOULD HOPE TO INCREASE UP TO THE TOP 10CM2 SIZE.,9N1T.00,Seen in psychiatry clinic,39562,39568,TP

TP15322,16172104,104,35104,2,1928,77,1,2395,19,1,31,429605,~~ MENTAL HEALTH UNIT ~~ HOSPITAL 09/05/05 THANK YOU FOR YOUR REFERRAL OF THIS SEVENTY-SEVEN YEAR OLD ~ WIDOW. I SAW HER AT HER HOME WITH MY CPN COLLEAGUE ~~ ON THE 13TH APRIL$ 2005. HER DAUGHTER AND NIECE WERE PRESENT AND ABLE TO GIVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW$ MRS. ~ HAS BEEN KNOWN TO OUR TEAM IN THE PAST. SHE WAS FIRST ASSESSED IN MAY 2002 AFTER SHE WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY A NEIGHBOURS CAR. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND TREATED WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS. FOLLOW-UP WAS THROUGH THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT UNTIL JUNE 2003 WHEN SHE WAS BRIEFLY ADMITTED TO OUR PSYCHIATRIC DAY HOSPITAL. UNFORTUNATELY SHE FAILED TO ENGAGE WITH THERAPY AND WAS EVENTUALLY DISCHARGED FROM OUR SERVICE IN AUGUST 2003. AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR LETTER$ THIS LADY HAS CONTINUED TO SUFFER SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. HER MENTAL STATE HOWEVER HAS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. AS WELL AS LOW MOOD SHE IS SHOWING SIGNS OF MEMORY LOSS AND CONFUSION. SHE HAS BEEN BLAMING CARERS AND FAMILY OF HIDING THINGS FROM HER$ PRESUMABLY WHEN SHE CANNOT FIND THEM. SHE RARELY LEAVES HER HOUSE AND HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY WITHDRAWN. SHE IS POORLY MOTIVATED AND IS BEGINNING TO SELF NEGLECT. SHE NO LONGER COOKS REGULARLY AND IS NOT EATING PARTICULARLY WELL. THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNS THAT SHE IS NOT COMPLIANT WITH HER ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. HER MAIN PLEASURE IN LIFE COMES FROM HER TWO CATS WHO SHE LOVES DEARLY. I WILL NOT REPEAT THIS LADY'S PERSONAL HISTORY AS THIS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. OTHER THAN MILD ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE$ OSTEOARTHRITIS AND OESOPHAGITIS SHE HAS NO MEDICAL HISTORY OF NOTE. SHE IS CURRENTLY TREATED WITH VENLAFAXINE 35 MGS BD WITH WHICH SHE IS POORLY COMPLIANT. TO MY KNOWLEDGE SHE NEITHER SMOKES$ DRINKS ALCOHOL NOR USES ILLICIT SUBSTANCES. SHE HAS NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT VASCULAR RISK FACTORS. MRS ~ HAS BEEN LIVING ALONE IN HER CURRENT HOUSE SINCE OCTOBER 2000. HER DAUGHTER LIVES OVER THE ROAD AND IS HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE. SHE IS ALSO VISITED REGULARLY BY HER NIECE WHO HELPS WITH HOUSEHOLD CHORES AND SHOPPING. SHE DID UNTIL RECENTLY HAVE A PRIVATE CARER WHO LEFT DUE TO HER DIFFICULT BEHAVIOUR. SHE CURRENTLY HAS NO SOCIAL SERVICES INPUT. DURING OUR VISIT WE FOUND THIS LADY'S HOUSE TO BE RELATIVELY CLEAN AND TIDY. SHE IS CLEARLY WELL LOOKED AFTER BY HER RELATIVES. ON MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION MRS. ~ PRESENTED AS A FAIRLY ANXIOUS ELDERLY ~ WOMAN. SHE APPEARED TO BE PHYSICALLY WELL AND WAS WELL KEMPT IN CLEAN CLOTHING. SHE WAS FAIRLY CO-OPERATIVE WITH THE INTERVIEW AND BEHAVES IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. SHE SPOKE IN A MIXTURE OF ENGLISH AND ~ OFTEN RELYING ON HER NIECE TO INTERPRET. SHE WAS UNABLE TO CLEARLY EXPRESS HERSELF AND SEEMED TO HAVE WORD FINDING DIFFICULTIES. OBJECTIVELY HER AFFECT WAS RATHER ANXIOUS BUT REACTIVE. SHE DENIED FEELING PARTICULARLY DEPRESSED AND MENTIONED THAT HER MOOD IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAD BEEN. SHE STILL HAS SOME SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION BUT DENIED ANY THOUGHTS OF HOPELESSNESS OR SUICIDE. I COULD ELICIT NO PERCEPTUAL ABNORMALITIES NOR OTHER PSYCHOTIC PHENOMENA. ON COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT SHE WAS POORLY ORIENTATED IN PLACE AND TIME. SHE WAS UNABLE TO RECALL ANY RECENT EVENTS AND HAD DIFFICULTY WITH SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HER POOR LITERACY$ SHE SCORED ONLY TWELVE OUT OF TWENTY-EIGHT ON THE MMSE. MY GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS THAT THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF GLOBAL COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. IN SUMMARY$ MRS. ~ IS A SEVENTY-SEVEN YEAR OLD ~ LADY WITH A HISTORY OF PTSD$ DEPRESSION AND MORE RECENTLY COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS OF DEMENTIA WHEN THERE IS AN UNDERLYING AFFECTIVE DISORDER. GIVEN HER HISTORY HOWEVER I THINK IT UNLIKELY THAT DEPRESSION WOULD ACCOUNT FOR HER DEGREE OF DISORIENTATION. AN ALZHEIMER'S TYPE PICTURE WOULD THEREFORE SEEM QUITE POSSIBLE. IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN$ I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT SHE UNDERGOES A MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT. THIS WOULD BEST BE PERFORMED AT THE ~ DEMENTIA DAY HOSPITAL. I HAVE SUGGESTED THIS TO HER AND HER FAMILY WHO AGREE TO OUR PLAN. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL RECEIVE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS$ IN THE MEANTIME I WILL ASK FOR HER TO BE MONITORED BY ONE OF OUR CPN'S. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE HER TO COMPLY WITH HER ANTIDEPRESSANT. IF YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESCRIBE THIS I WOULD BE GRATEFUL.,9N36.00,Letter from specialist,38481,38481,TP
